## Diabetes Prediction:

**Dataset Overview:**
Pima Indian Diabetes dataset from Kaggle. This has 768 rows and 9 columns.
This dataset contains medical information about females aged 21 and above of Pima Indian Heritage.

**Objective:**
To build a classification model that predicts if a female patient has diabetes or not based on the medical details.

**Approach:**
1. Handled duplicate values.
2. Handled missing values.
3. Handled inconsistant data.
4. Handled outliers.
5. Did Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA).
6. Split the data into train and test.
7. Model Selection and model building: Since the output column is a nominal categorical variable we are dealing with a classification problem. I have applied **Logistic Regression** and **KNN**.
8. Evaluated the model performance.
9. Reported the model performance and key insights.
