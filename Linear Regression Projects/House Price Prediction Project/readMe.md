## House Price Prediction:

**Dataset Overview:**
Boston House Prices dataset from Kaggle. This dataset has 506 rows and 14 columns.

**Objective:**
To create a model that predicts the price of the house based on the given 13 input features and also identify the key features that play a role in determining the house prices.

**Approach:**
1. Handled missing values.
2. Handled outliers.
3. Applied Feature Scaling.
4. Did Feature Selection.
5. Split the data into train and test.
6. Model Selection and model building: Since the output column is numeric and continuous, we are dealing with a regression problem. I applied **Multiple Linear Regression**, **Lasso and Ridge Regression**, and **Polynomial Regression**.
7. Evaluated the model performance.
8. Checked the assumptions of Linear Regression.
9. Reported the model performance and significant feature variables.
