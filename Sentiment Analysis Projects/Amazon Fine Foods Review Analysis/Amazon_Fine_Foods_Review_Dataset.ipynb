I love all things spicy (my wife says I'm not human in this regard) and enjoy all sorts of hot peppers, so since it has both spicy heat and a realist taste, these are now one of my favorite things. The rest of my family is split on these, with my wife that saying they are way too hot for her and my son says he enjoys the flavor but is on the borderline with the heat.<br /><br />This flavor is from David Klein, the creator of the famous \\\"Jelly Belly\\\" jelly beans, so I was thrilled to be offered this to review since my family loves jelly beans.<br /><br />I also really like that these jelly beans are made with natural flavors and colors.<br /><br />Highly recommended for those that enjoy hot peppers!

The consistency is nice and smooth with zero chalkiness, which most energy shakes are ruined by. This one is just perfect as far as flavor and consistency.<br /><br />To other reviewers saying the shakes have too many calories and not enough protein: these are not intended specifically as protein shakes. That's why they're called \\\"Nutrition\\\" shakes. If you want a specific protein shake, there are many of them available. I look at these as a light meal replacement or as an after work out energy replacement.<br /><br />An interesting note: The cans are made of steel not aluminum; they are much heavier and stronger than aluminum cans which means they can be stored in a gym back and not accidentally get burst open.\",\n          \"Greenies are wonderful, my dog loves them and chews them up! I don't notice much as far as better breath, but I already brush his teeth and scale them. He gets 1 greenie each night for a snack :)<br /><br />(To the bad reviews/comments...if your dog is one to scarf treats and does not chew things up before swallowing, these are not a good idea! If your dog enjoys the chewing and gnawing, make sure you get the proper size for your dog so they do not choke. Also giving these to puppies can upset their stomache, hints the diarhhea comment previously)\",\n          \"So you don't want to spend $100/oz for truffle, here's a great alternative. Use this formula to build your fantastic sandwich.<br />(Buns) + (Spread) + (Meat) + (Creamy) + (Veggies)<br /><br />I used Chabatta buns I get at Albertson, toasted in a small oven, spread Urbani Truffles and mushrooms, layer with thin slices of prosciutto, then topped with four thick slices of hass avocado, and a few mix green. There's your fancy, sexy, impress your gf/bf/family/friends sandwich.<br /><br />The only bad part is it doesn't keep very long in fridge. Urbani Truffles and Mushrooms add an umami flavor to the sandwich so it can go with any of your favorite sandwich. I usually just a make two sandwiches and had to throw away the rest when it went bad in the fridge. So plan ahead, it's a small 6 oz can that can serve up to four sandwiches.<br /><br />Plus it's cheaper via Amazon.com. I saw these at Wholefood for $19.99/can.<br /><br />This is my first review so it was that good that wanted me to write a review.

      "I really do not know what the issue is with this goat milk. My one year old daughter has suffered horrible constipation since switching to cow milk on her birthday. After a month of us both suffering (because I had to help it along if you get my drift), I switched her to goat milk. After 2 days, she was passing perfectly soft stools. The goat milk definitely cured her of the constipation, but each can I open seems to be different. Sometimes when I reconsitute it, I know right away that it is going to taste terrible because the smell is so strong. Other cans, I hardly notice it. She will not drink the bad-smelling milk, and when I have tried it, I have nearly vomitted! Majorly salty and gamey tasting.<br />Compared to fresh (Meyenberg from the fridge section of grocery store), well, it really doesn't compare. I have found the fresh to taste sweet, like cream, and then there is a little gamey after-taste, but nothing like the slap-you-in-the-face taste of the powdered. I was hoping to save money with the powdered, but since it is a 50/50 chance she won't drink certain cans, I am really wasting money. I am thinking I will have to stick with the fresh from now on.<br />If anyone has any ideas about what the difference between cans could be, I would love to hear it! I always have prepared it with Britta-filtered water (warmed on the stove) and mixed it up in pyrex, then stored it in a large Ball jar in fridge. (I know I should prob call the company and talk to them, but that would require me to actually remember to do it at a time that they are open and I am able - never happens!!)Thanks!\n",

      "the first time i had coconut water (juice), i wasn't a fan - it isn't what you'd expect, if you expect ripe coconut flavor.  it is an acquired taste in my opinion.  that being said, i really love it now.  i drink at least one serving a day.  i was hesitant to try the lime flavor because i like the regular version so much.  i picked some up and it is a great twist on the original.  it reminds me of lemon-lime gatorade but without all the sugar.  i use this to give me an energy boost before a workout and ALWAYS have some after an intense session.  if you ever need to replenish your body after dehydrating for a weigh-in, replace your gatorade or pedialyte with this!  it is the most refreshing and replenishing beverage i've ever had.  try all varieties of this brand.  i've had zico (tetro and bottle), o.n.e., vita coco, and goya (don't do it) and A&B has the best flavor by far...most similar to what i got from a young thai coconut.\n",

      "This is great tasting movie theater popcorn that can be enjoyed in your popcorn machine for days after being popped. It is good to have a convienent 4oz package to easily make up great tasting batches of popcorn when wanted. We have a Nostalgia Electric 4oz Movie Time Popcorn Cart in our home theater room and this makes it perform like a professional model producing real movie theater popcorn. You can even add a tiny bit of Orville Redenbacher's Buttery Flavor Popping and Topping oil to get extra butter flavor, like when adding butter topping at the movies. We were concerned about possible lingering popcorn smell in our theater room, but this has not been an issue at all. Clean up is a bit more involved than after using just regular oil and popcorn (more oil and seasoning thrown around), but it is not too bad and worth the effort. This is a great product for 4oz machines.\n",

The value is much greater this way because the amount of coffee you are receiving, but some people rather crush it themselves.

      "This gluten-free starch  is used to thicken soups and gravies.  Its main advantage over other starch thickeners is that it's a permitted ingredient for Passover, unlike cornstarch and other grain-based foods. Liquids thickened with potato starch should never be boiled.  Supermarkets often stock it among the Kosher products. I have used this in cakes and in some gentle sauces.  There is no taste that comes from this so just the flavor of the ingredients comes through.  It is very silky and fine.  Remember you do not want to let your sauce boil with this starch.  Those who are on a gluten free diet may be able to use this.\n",

      "I was looking for a healthy alternative to regular wheat grass which is becoming harder to find in health stores... and this is not just for me! I also grow this in trays for my 2 cats who live indoors, deprived of valuable natural chlorophyll. All mammals need it, and we are now enjoying a strong, healthy organically grown variety which is easy to grow and lasts a long time. Wheat grass has larger blades than lawn grass which does not induce the cats to being sick. They crave it and are very healthy with glossy soft coats, their energy levels are better, and they are playing more. Both are perfectly healthy. Chlorophyll is kind of like eating liquid sunshine mixed in with vegetation. It does a body good! If you care about your (or other) bodies, then get this very nice product. The shipping is fast and it is packaged well. The cans are sealed well with a tight-fitting lid. Yes, I am going to continue ordering from this vendor again.

      "This is one of the most delicious teas I have ever tasted! It's so smooth, rich and flavorful. A perfect dessert tea. The best way to enjoy it, in my opinion, is plain/black. That way, nothing interferes with the flavors and you can taste each one distinctly - the black tea, caramel and vanilla (despite the name, the caramel is stronger than the vanilla) - as well as experience how they interact and balance each other. It truly is a harmonious blend.<br /><br />For an extra sweet, creamy treat, I sometimes like to add Half & Half and one sugar cube (about 35 calories total). It tastes amazing that way too, though the sweeteners do mute the caramel and vanilla a bit.<br /><br />Whatever you do, please do NOT add honey to this tea. I did that twice and ended up with a bitter cup. (Honey brings out a sharp burnt flavor in the caramel.)\n",

      "When we received our Keurig Elite for Christmas, we were so excited to break open the sample pack of pods to try out different blends and flavors. Of the 12 pods we had in the box, four were Green Mountain Coffee brand. I'd never tried anything from this company before, but from what I had researched online, they have the largest range of Keurig pods and have even bought out competitors to produce coffee under their brand names as well.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I was immediately disappointed by the quality of the coffee. We tried their Dark Magic, Decaf and Breakfast Blend and all were underwhelming, to say the least. I was almost completely set on writing off Green Mountain altogther.<br /><br />We had one GM pod left and being of the mindset of waste-not-want-not, I figured I'd give it one last go around before forgetting about them completely. And I'm glad I did.<br /><br />The Nantucket Blend is a perfectly pleasing cup of coffee. It is nice and flavorful without being thick and pungent (unlike some of the other GM blends we tried). I added some flavored creamer to it and it almost measures up to our go-to Caribou Blend pods. Almost. All in all, this is a very standard cup of coffee which, while it isn't anything new or exciting, is very pleasing and definitely one of the better Keurig options we've been able to test out. When we run out of all the pods we've accumulated, I'll probably pick up a box of these as well.<br /><br />Now that I know Green Mountain isn't completely disappointing I'll definitely be open to trying a few more of their coffees (with our promotion for getting the bewer we ordered <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I3Y4IE\">Green Mountain Coffee Golden French Toast,  K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a> to try as well) and see how it goes from there.<br /><br />If you're looking for a go-to choice, this is your cup!\n",

      "I cannot say how much I love Kettle brand potato chips. Kettle brand has a large variety of unique flavors, and the quality of the chips themselves blows all other potato chips out of the water. The ingredients list is printed on each bag and the only thing really bad for it is the oil they are frying the chips in. I love that these aren't filled with nasty chemicals. I ordered the cheddar and sour cream krinkle cut ones which are great but I was torn between the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0048IFUSC\">Kettle Brand Potato Chips Fully Loaded Baked Potato, 2-Ounce (Pack of 24)</a> and the Jalapeno flavor. While I know the jalapeno flavor is good but this is way better. They include liquid smoke instead of actual bacon which I'm fine with since I've a vegetarian. I ordered this to give to guests coming from out of town for my wedding this spring and I can't guarantee how many I will have left. My fiance and I love these.

I was mortified to say the least...  Then he wanted to know (jokingly) if he had done something to make me mad & I bought these for him as his punishment.  (No, but I had to laugh when he asked about that.)<br />Me personally, I have not tried them.

      "I love Amazon and I love the reviews from people, I've been introduced to alot of great products b/c of the reviews, but this time? Total, complete LET DOWN! Popchips having 4.5 stars is just down right perplexing!?! The should not get more than a 3, but generally 1-2. I sorta want to give it a 1, but the packaging is very pretty and aesthetically pleasing so I through in the extra point.<br /><br />I ordered these thinking that'd they'd be maybe a slightly better version of Baked Lays. Man was I wrong... I've tried most of the Baked Lays flavors, my go-to's at first were 1.) original baked lays and 2.) sour cream baked lays (since those are my favorite regular lays). But then  I discovered BBQ Baked Lays. And seriously, those are FANTASTICALLY great. BBQ Baked Lays are packed with SO much flavor.<br /><br />These Popchips taste like slightly burnt airpocket chips. Literally they do. Because they aren't as good as Baked Lays I can definitely see eating much less of them (which could be a benefit), but I say just use portion control-- and zip lock bag a bunch of Baked Lays.<br /><br />I'm trying to think of ways to go into more detail, but there's really not much more I can say.<br /><br />****SUMMARY****<br /><br />How do Popchips taste? Like slightly burnt air chips. (it's sort of a weird taste, takes ALOT of getting used to)<br /><br />Would I suggest buying them? No. If you're eager to try them, I say buy a bag from your local grocery store. A week or so after I ordered these on here I saw them at m local Krogers, so they're definitely expanding.<br /><br />Nutrition Information: 1 bag (.8 oz/ 23g) = 100 calories, Total Fat = 3g (5%), Sodium = 210 mg (9%), Total Carbohydrate = 16g (5%), Dietary Fiber = 1 g (4%), Sugar = 2g, Protein 1 g, Vitamin A , Vitamin C, Calcium, and Iron = 2 %.<br /><br />If you buy a big bag of BBQ Popchips and big bag of BBQ Baked Lays, here are the nutrition information side-by-side:<br /><br />**POP CHIPS:**<br />Serving Size: 1oz/28g/about 19 chips, Calories= 120, Total Fat = 4.5g (6%), Sodium 280mg (11%), Total Carbohydrate 20g (6%),<br />Dietary Fiber 1g (4%), Sugars 2g, Protein 1g<br /><br />**BAKED LAYS:**<br />Serving Size= 1oz/28g/about 19 chips, Calories = 120, Total Fat 3g (5%),  Sodium 210mg (9%), Potassium 230mg, Total Carbohydrate 22g (7%), Dietary Fiber 2g 8%, Sugars 3g, Protein 2g, Vitamin C 4%, Calcium 2%<br /><br />So these two are very close, but Baked Lays wins because it virtually has not sodium, since potassium 230mg offsets the Sodium 210mg, leaving 20g of Potassium. Plus there's more Fiber and more Vitamin C. And most importantly they taste better.<br /><br />I for one have to be careful about my sodium intake so the fact that Baked Lays has potassium in it is a huge benefit.<br /><br />At the end of the day make a decision for yourself, but I'd strongly advise you to purchase a bag from the store first. Maybe even compare your favorite flavor in both Baked Lays and Popchips... I can almost guarantee you that Baked Lays will win hands down.<br /><br />(Hopefully Amazon starts selling well-priced variety single-serve bags of Baked Lays soon. For now I found one from a seller, but the price seems a little high (but there are 40 bags instead of 20): <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TVDHIO\">Smart Mix Variety Pack, 30-Count: 7-Baked Lay's Classic, 6-Baked Cheetos, 6-Baked Ruffles, 6-Baked Doritos Nachos Cheese & 5-Rold Gold Tiny Twists (Pack of 2)</a> )\n",

      "Charlee Bears are small and low calorie, so you can use them en masse for training.  We use them both for standard training (sit, stay, drop it, leave it) and behavioral training (no bark).  They're not stinky or messy, so you can put them in your pocket, purse, or car without worry.  We keep a small bag in the car for travel to reinforce when our puppy doesn't bark at people walking by, one by the door to reinforce when she goes to the bathroom outside, and a bunch of treats in a treat bag for travel.<br /><br />The one downside to these is that because they're not as stinky, it can be harder to use them to get your dog's attention if he or she is distracted, like at the dog park or if you have a bunch of visitors.  Our trick to get around this is that we put some stinky treats in the treat bag with these, and they'll take on some of the scent (We use <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DGRSY\">Pro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried Dog Treats, 21 Ounce</a>).<br /><br />Our dog loves all flavors.\n",

After our favorable experience with the Caribou brand before, we picked up a box of this coffee and hoped that it would be a great choice for a dark blend.<br /><br />Let me just say that Mahogany is full of smokey delicious flavor.  It's quite strong and dark, but there is no rancid bitterness or acidity that accompanies a lot of the dark roasts.  This coffee packs a powerful punch.  Although that isn't normally my thing, I can enjoy a cup of this with milk and a bit of sweetener.  My boyfriend adores it, though, and it has become a staple blend for him.  I will still drink this on occasion, but it's a bit too potent for me.<br /><br />I think this is the best dark roast I've had the chance to try.\n",

To briefly address these: There has been no evidence that Mrs. Mays keeps its workers in sweatshops; despite the Communism, I'm sure the individual citizens find these jobs valuable; and ships produce 1/10th the carbon per pound-mile of trucks, meaning a 5000 miles by ship is as bad as 500 miles by truck.<br /><br />I really like the snack and I'd give it five stars, but I'm subtracting one star: I think it is deceptive that it was so hard to find out the snack was made in China. I don't have a problem with the snack's origin, but Mrs. Mays should be more forthright with their customers and let them make the decision themselves. Granted, most of us Americans are primed to flip out at the latest Scare of the Week, but that should be our choice to make.<br /><br />Oh, and the snack itself? It is quite tasty, filling, and healthy. I will continue to purchase it.\n",

It does have some dusting of a white fructose sprinkle as perhaps a nostalgic tribute. Don't get me wrong, as the Oreo Thin Crisps are perfectly fine as low-calorie chocolate wafer alternatives go. They simply lack the lip-smacking satisfaction of a disassembled Oreo digested in pieces. The whole point of the 0.81-ounce bag of wafers is to tout that they are \"100 Calorie Packs\", a fine idea for Weight Watchers advocates and the rest of us who should be watching our weight.

After doing some research I realized that Science Diet is no better than any grocery store generic brand or Iams (I would NOT recommend ANY of these options).<br /><br />The main ingredients are Chicken By-Product and Corn. Here are some interesting facts: Cat's can't digest corn...in fact, they are obligatory carnivores and only eat up until the point of reaching optimal nutrition. When I fed my cat the science diet he ate ALL THE TIME, constantly. After switching him over to Castor and Pollux Indoor Cat Formula he eats much less now.<br /><br />Also, By-Product means just that...beaks, feathers, toe-nail clippings, meat not suitable for human consumption, dead animals, etc. -- Totally not worth the $$$ ...it's cheaper just to dig in the trash and puree it yourself (doesn't sound so appealing does it??). Science Diet is notorious for implying superior quality products when they are in fact no better than all the other terrible pet food you find. Don't let your vet fool you either- vets usually get a 40% cut from Hill's to sell you their cat food.<br /><br />My recommendation is to use common sense and to do some research. Try brands like Newmans Own or Castor and Pollux as they have wholesome ingredients and a proven track record.<br /><br />I later called the shelter only to hear that they are required to feed the animals Science Diet as it is donated and they have a special arrangement with Petsmart to house their animals in their in store adoption centers.

      "With <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00389Q4XW\">Green Mountain Hot Cocoa</a> being perpetually out of stock in the winter, I thought I'd give the cheaper Grove Square brand a shot.<br /><br />Since the K-Cup patents are starting to sunset, Grove Square is one of the first \"unofficial\" producers of \"we can't legally call these K-Cups but they work in your Keurig(R)(TM) coffee maker\" pods, and I thought that I'd be getting the same overall quality, without the licensing fees tacked on to the price.<br /><br />Well... I was right about Grove Square being cheaper. But I think that's the nicest I can be.<br /><br />As others have pointed out, there's a definite \"diet\" or \"<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E6LBXK\">Splenda</a>\" aftertaste. This hadn't been reviewed yet when I bought it, so I didn't see the warnings from others, and re-checked the ingredients several times to make sure.<br /><br />\"Well... it's got 60 calories, which seems a bit lower than Green Mountain, but a bit high for something that diet-conscious people would want.\" and the ingredient list didn't seem to point to obvious \"diet\" sweeteners.<br /><br />The overall taste is kind of like someone dropped a sugar-free Tootsie Roll in your hot water, using the normal cup setting. Going one size down didn't seem to improve much, beyond making a weak chocolate flavor sweeter - but that just meant a heavier shot of low-calorie sweetener to the taste buds.<br /><br />The way I see it, I saved about $5 by going with this brand. On the other hand, now I've got 20 of these cups left that are probably going in the trash if I can't sucker someone... er... please my discerning guests... with a few cups.<br /><br />If you drink diet soft drinks by choice, you're probably going to like this.\n",

      "\"Patrick\" gave a spot on explanation of everything, just in different uses. Personally, I use it vocally, and acoustically and it has worked perfectly in every way, however, either something is lacking in craftsmanship or  i find my ability to adjust by feel is a little more connected to using numbers instead of blanks. I found the quality just like Patrick said. I too think it \"feels almost fragile;\" And, \"I also used...a mic cable\" because for me, that seemed the most sensible solution because I didn't really need it to move it. So, I mounted the connection to my desk; And now I move it very little. Aside from the \"no dial or indicators for how far you have turned it,\" on the gain knob, i think it would be awesome if they just threw in some molded heavy something to give it some weight for setting on your desk. That would make it secure and you would feel like it had a little better quality in craftsmanship. Hey maybe even give the connector itself a littl weight to stay put. Anyways, great product but I guess, \"Thats what... he said?...\" Regardless,<br /><br />Pros: Does what it says. Get it if you need it. Its at an amazing price compared to the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PPXFAG\">Shure X2U XLR-to-USB Signal Adapter</a> version.

I am a little disappointed that the box will only make one recipe that calls for two cups of the mix. I doubled my recipe for the pancakes which made 14<br />4 inch pancakes.  The recipe says it makes 10 pancakes with 1 cup of the mix. Those 10 pancakes must be silver dollar size.  I am looking forward to making the biscuits so I will have to open a second box to have enough mix. The recipe calls for eggs for biscuits and I never used eggs in my regular biscuits.

I would have voted for Devil's Food Cake, although it may be politically incorrect these days to mention, you know, The Devil, so I may have voted for German Chocolate Cake, but Germany is, you know, the Old Europe, so I  may have voted for a chocolate cupcake. But without peanuts because so many people are now allergic to peanuts that they can't even serve 0.5 grams of salted nuts on airplanes. Sigh.<br /><br />Where was I? Hmmm? Oh, yes....<br /><br />I certainly would vote for Duncan Hines cake but I feel it should be mentioned that this is not cake.....yet. This is cake mix.<br /><br />Its sort of a cake fetus, or a cake stem cell. It still needs lots of development. You have to add additional ingredients and warmth and time to develop the mix into a cake. There is the promise of cake, but unless you follow the protocol written on the box very carefully, you may not get cake. Depending on what you do, you may get something very odd and rubbery or something very dark and charred.<br /><br />It's complicated!<br /><br />Amazon has allowed third-party vendors to offer Duncan Hines Cake Mixes for sale for quite some time. An example of this is: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002IMS5K\">Duncan Hines Classic Yellow Layer Cake Mix 18.25 oz - 6 Unit Pack</a>. Amazon, being a very clever retailer, has obviously read the numerous, highly enthusiastic customer reviews for this product, and has now started selling these products directly to its customers, so many of whom must be begging for a six pack of a product readily available in any supermarket or convenience store.<br /><br />In order to enhance customer demand, Amazon's copywriters have outdone themselves listing this product's outstanding features:<br /><br />-Pack of six, 16.5 18.25 ounces each (now 1.75 oz. lighter!)<br />-The moistest, most delicious<br />-A special treat for the special people<br /><br />Of course, \"the special people\" must be those who voted for Duncan Hines Yellow Cake Mix. That's why it's \"America's Favorite Cake\". Makes perfect sense. This is a Democracy! This is a great country and this is great cake mix!<br /><br />Another thing you should know is that you get six boxes of cake mix. This is enough mix to incubate a very, very big sheet cake that would require a very, very large incubator or oven. You could also prepare a tall 12 layer cake which would kind of look like a miniature version of the Coit Tower in San Francisco. Certainly enough \"the moistest, most delicious\" yellow cake for a very large number of \"the special people\".<br /><br />Finally, a charming aspect is that on the very same page as this product, Amazon suggests \"Customers Who Bought This Product Also Bought\": Cottonelle Fresh Flushable Wipes, Refills, Case of 4 / 84s (336 ct). Obviously, \"the special people\" anticipate getting down with this cake. Six boxes of cake mix is bound to make a mess in the kitchen and later on, there will be cake crumbs on lips and chins and fingers.<br /><br />A few Cottonelle Fresh Flushable Wipes could come in handy!<br /><br />Smart!\n",

      "Wonderful, smooth, satisfying decaf coffee with a fabulously rich flavor.  No chemical aftertaste, like many decafs I've tried.  Apparently, the Swiss Water Process used to decaffeinate this coffee leaves flavor intact, something I've found terribly disappointing in other brands.<br /><br />I've been VERY impressed by the flavor dimensions of this Riviera Sunset blend; served it to some neighbors (who simply won't touch decaf coffee) who were pleasantly surprised to find they actually enjoyed a cup of decaf.  No bitter notes; my husband, who usually complains fervently about the flavor of decaf, has been asking for a cup of this every evening, after dinner.

This method also allows me to brew strong coffee (for me) and a milder version for my hubby.<br /><br />Take time to \"bloom the grounds\" first (add a little hot water to the fresh coffee grounds, moistening completely, and then wait about 30 seconds before brewing) for best flavor (this goes for ANY coffee).<br /><br />Melitta's Riviera Sunset decaf blend is enthusiastically recommended by a coffee snob!  You'll love it as is, no sweeteners or creams needed to disguise this wonderful flavor.  I look forward to ordering more.<br /><br />Update 9/21/10:  Just ordered my first 3-pack through Subscribe & Save; great deal for some delicious decaf!\n",

      "I enjoy my coffee with plenty of sugar and a flavored creamer. This provided a good base for that experience. As a non-connoisseur, this is just about right: not too strong, not bitter, good \"coffee\" flavor.<br /><br />For the sake of comparison, I most often drink the ground version of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ55MM\">Eight O'Clock Coffee, 50% Decaf Whole Bean, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)</a> Right now on Amazon, Melitta's is slightly more expensive per ounce, though Subscribe and Save would even it out and Melitta's brewing instructions call for using a smaller amount of grounds. I would expect them to be about the same quality, and in my opinion they were. This is certainly a coffee I'm happy to drink when I want decaf.<br /><br />One downside is the bag. My husband got to it before I did, but he reported that it required scissors to get it open. The resealing feature on the bag then couldn't be used, so we made the transfer to another sealed container.\n",

      "Like most Melitta brews, I found this one to be somewhat middle of the road.  It's certainly not undrinkable, but it's not the first one I'd reach for, either.  As many of the other reviewers mentioned, I did find it nearly undrinkable when brewed in the quantity shown; I think you have to at least double the amount you use to get a good cup, so take that into consideration when figuring the value.<br /><br />I'm a little sensitive to caffeine and like to have a decaf on hand for drinking later in the day, and I bought this primarily to use with my Mr. Coffee frappe maker (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002FWMF8G\">Mr. Coffee BVMC-FM1 20-Ounce Frappe Maker</a>; let me just put in a quick pitch for that, I love it!)  I found the \"Riviera Sunset\" stood up well to all the milk, flavoring, and ice inherent in making a frappe (again, with a significant increase in the amount used).<br /><br />I would probably not purchase this coffee just because of my own views on coffee; I look for bird-friendly, Fair Trade brands, and I find nothing to indicate that Melitta makes any effort to meet these expectations.  Leaving aside these considerations, though, I think those who enjoy a somewhat light, easy-drinking brew would like this coffee.\n",

      "The aroma of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TMV3E4\">Melitta Cafe Collection Riviera Sunset Decaffeinated Ground Coffee, 10-Ounce Bags)</a> was fairly weak. Scent, after all, is a huge part of taste, and this was disappointing.<br /><br />Even though I added more coffee grinds than the directions instructed, I found the coffee to be a bit bland. The taste was more than flavored water, but not amazingly so, with no subtle overtones. It wasn't bitter, but it wasn't much of anything.<br /><br />While I generally drink hi-test as opposed to decaffeinated, I do drink decaf at least twice a week. The <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TMV3E4\">Melitta</a> was comparable to the generic brand that I usually have.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TMV3E4\">Melitta Cafe Collection riviera Sunset Decaf</a> isn't a bad coffee, but it's not worth the money if there are other options available.\n",

      "Index: 4570\n",
      "Riviera Sunset Decaffinated Coffee, from the Melitta Caf&eacute; Collection, is a good coffee for that first, morning cup of coffee.  It is a South American blend for those who prefer a brighter more acidic kind of brew, but is still well balanced and make s a fine cup of Java.<br /><br />The coffee comes in an attractive,  black bag with a bag with the now ubiquitous air valve.  The folks at Melitta know how to compact coffee for travel--all ambient air was sucked out of the bag, shrinking the usual size of the 10 ounces from its expected size, to a small, dense brick.  Cutting open the bag, there was an audible hiss as the bag seemed to expand to double its size.  The aroma was intoxicating--think deep coffee with chocolate hints and with nothing acrid about it.  The bag does not indicate the level of the roast, but on inspection the coffee appears to be a darker roast (somewhere between a `full city' and European).  The bag states that this is an extra fine grind, but on inspection it seems to be less powdery than you'd want for fine espresso, and is more of a fine grind.  This, I imagine, is meant a compromise so that the coffee is suitable for both the common drip coffee machines that use a filter or could be used with an espresso machine.<br /><br />For some reason, the instructions indicate that you should use two level teaspoons for every six ounces of water.  I'm not sure how they drink coffee in Europe, but in the US coffee machines measure by the cup.  This leads to a bizarre ~2.7 teaspoons of coffee per cup and (to my taste) a slightly weak cup of coffee.  In spite of the grind, I'd stick with the usual 1 tablespoon per cup proportion for your drip coffee maker and work up from there.  Your intuition should serve you well, and I'd stick with your usual measurements (I'm one of those `heaping' tablespoon per cup guys).<br /><br />The coffee definitely shows its South American origins.  In spite of the darkness of the roast and richness of the aroma, the coffee once  brewed is more light, breakfasty, and slightly more acidic than I imagined it would be. Given the type of coffee that it is, it also might have benefited from a slightly lighter roast. Still, it is a well balanced South American blend.  It lacks the distinctiveness of a single origin coffee but given that it is a blend has a more rounded, less biting flavor.  Although decaffeinating can sometimes sap the bold flavors of a coffee, this coffee still has a lot of personality and a distinctive taste.<br /><br />This is not for the pure coffee lover who likes a dark, earthy, and oily cup of java that can basically stand on its own.  This coffee is more for people who like to add a lot of buffer--a fair amount of milk and sugar or one of those Torani syrups (e.g. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E2QS\">Torani Syrup, Vanilla, 25.4-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)</a>) for a little extra flavor, for those who like those kind of things.  It also makes a great iced coffee.  If cold brewed, the coffee loses its tannic edge and is more smooth and sweet, but also loses a little personality in the process. (I did not try using this in an espresso machine as I do not have one, but I don't think that it would yield a great espresso.  Concentrated, I think the acidity might become overwhelming.)<br /><br />All in all, this is a fine blend of coffee at a fine price.  With a little experimentation on the proportions, it yields a fine cup of breakfast coffee.\n",

They smelled like melted plastic, and something else I'd hesitate to even guess what it is, but it's bad. I bravely pulled out one small crisp, hoping that maybe it was the packaging that had the ... aroma. It was not. The crisp itself smells horrific.<br />I figured there was no way it could taste as bad as it smelled.<br />Second problem is that I was very, very wrong about that. They have a funky, chemical taste that just defies description. The aftertaste is sort of like a skunky/chewing on a plastic pen cap that went thru the wash/wet cardboard kinda taste.

      "As far as taste goes, this is the best coconut water I've tasted. I have not tried all the other brands, so I am only comparing this to coconut water ordered at restaurants (which I think is usually sweetened, so it really isn't a fair comparison), Vitacoco, and Amy and Brian's. Vitacoco uses Brazilian coconuts while Taste Nirvana and Amy and Brian's use Thai coconuts. It seems like Taste Nirvana and Amy and Brian's are naturally sweeter than Vitacoco, with Taste Nirvana being the sweetest. This is a good sweet though, since all of these three brands have no sugars added. While I've liked all the coconut water I've tasted, Vitacoco can have a slightly more salty and less sweet taste, while Taste Nirvana has an amazing taste with just the right amount of sweetness. I liked the pulp as well, although some of the pieces seem to be from more mature coconuts rather than the young almost gelatin pulps I'm used to at some restaurants.<br /><br />The only reason I took a star off is due to the price. These 9.5 oz bottles are not the most economical way to buy Taste Nirvana. In fact, at the current price this costs as much as I paid at the coffee shop for individual bottles. For the best bargain on this brand, buy <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OW342G\">Taste Nirvana Real Coconut Water With Pulp, 16.2-Ounce (Pack of 12)</a>.<br /><br />I wanted to try this brand because a lot of people say Taste Nirvana or Amy and Brian's taste the best, and I'd have to give my vote to Taste Nirvana. Hopefully some day I will taste a fresh coconut and maybe that will get my vote, but if you're like me and don't have any coconut trees nearby, try this out. Enjoy!\n",

      "This is a great food and my cat loves it! The only thing that seems a bit strange to me is the difference in consistency between batches, and even the difference in consistency between the 3 ounce cans and the 5 ounce cans. Seriously, it looks like a different food, with the 3 ounce cans looking much smoother in texture, and the 5 ounce cans looking much more \"grainy\". I hope that the following review will help someone with a cat that has stomach issues similar to mine...<br /><br />I have tried many, many products aimed at helping with digestive upset for my cat. Her pain and suffering was so great that I thought I was going to have to put her to sleep. I went to multiple vets and had thousands of dollars worth of diagnostics done to try and find out why she was having acid reflux, crying and subsequently vomitting (endoscopy, xray, ultrasound, bloodwork, etc). One vet told me to just give her pepcid. This worked for a while, but then became completely ineffective after a while. The same vet then told me that she probably just has food allergies and would have to be on steroids for the rest of her life, and thats all that could be done, and prescribed different kinds of Science Diet (which we all know is actually a terrible food for cats with digestive problems).<br /><br />Well, what do you know, the steroids didn't help AT ALL. I tried probiotics of various brands for pets, I tried digestive enzymes, I tried many different natural products designed to help ease digestive / intestinal inflammation.... I tried a homiopathic vet (the only one in my area) and spent a few thousand more dollars rerunning tests and running other tests for pancreatitis, etc. I tried MAKING her food from raw meat to try and eliminate food allergies to commericial foods as a potential problem, etc. I TRIED EVERYTHING, but still my cat was constantly licking her lips, then crying in terrible pain and vomitting very consistently, and now was losing interest in her food and was losing weight and starting to look boney. I was determined to not give up on her though. I had just lost my wife to infection during a failed bone marrow transplant / cancer during all this, and was not about to give up on my girl.<br /><br />I stopped making her food and started getting her Natures Variety canned Rabbit formula and the duck formula. She loved the food but it did not seem to be helping her feel all that much better, even though a lot of other people were having great success. I then found a site called wellvet dot com that said that the Ulcinex was very effective at repairing ulcers and the stomach lining in pets. It also said that it was very effective at controlling vomitting that occurs a few hours after eating, which is EXACTLY what was consistently happening, and no other product that I had found so far claimed to do same thing. I was skeptical as soon as it started talking about chinese herbs and such, but I figured it was worth a shot.<br /><br />I started giving this as prescribed from wellvet ALONG WITH Georges Aloe Vera juice (the one without preservatives and no taste), which is said to help a lot for acid reflux sufferers (I found a few people that said it worked great for their cats), and continuing the rabbit / duck formula. All the while praying, within a few days I started noticing a drastic improvement. She was licking her lips less, and was able to relax for longer periods of time without jumping up in pain and crying. She vommitted once within a several day period. Several days later, NO MORE CRYING, and instead of hiding behind the bedroom door licking her lips the whole night, she started sleeping with me at night like she used to. Now, several weeks later, she is literally 90% better. NO MORE VOMITTING AT ALL, is in very little pain, VERY little lip licking and only very occasionally at that. She also gets much more rest, and has put on several pounds and is back above her normal weight and has a nice chubby belly. My cat suffered daily for 2 long years during this whole process before I found this and the other two mentioned products. The aloe vera juice on its own didn't seem to completely do the trick, so I think its the combination of the three things that is really effective. I only hope that no permanent damage has already been done, but now I have my cat back and don't have to suffer through losing a great wife and a great cat. If you have a cat with severe stomach issues, you owe it to yourself and your cat to try this along with the Georges Aloe Vera and Ulcinex.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006IICOM\">Metagenics - Ulcinex - 90 Tablets</a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QV9TA0\">Warren Laboratories - George's Aloe Vera, 64 fl oz liquid</a>\n",

      "First Indiana Jones found the \"Lost Ark of the Covenant\", then the \"Mystical Stone from the Temple of Doom\", then \"The Holy Grail\" and finally the \"Palace of The Crystal Skull\"...But the loser still cant find \"The Lost Lakewood Bottle of Real, Honest 100% \"PURE CARROT Juice\" Minus Lemons\" not without \"Short Round\" anyway.<br /><br />I tried to leave \"no stars\" or fewer cuz, I felt and tasted the pain of other misguided customers, I spewed out my first rancid acidic taste of this clearly labeled, \"PURE CARROT\" Juice. Lakewood's knucklehead faux pas is their troglodytian approach to the label design. I can easily read \"PURE CARROT\" and \"PURE\" again, just above the illustration of \"CARROTS ONLY\" (but nada lemons), but in much smaller print at the very bottom of the label and below the CARROTS ONLY illustration (sans lemons), it mentions \"enriched with lemons\", 1% to be exact, which means 99% of their marketing team make O'Donnell look constitutionally wise.<br /><br />Intentional or not, it aint the keenest marketing approach to \"thinking\" consumers. To paraphrase a wiser woman, \"You might want to rethink those ties.\" (LABELS in this case)~ E.Brockovich ~.  Even Juicy Juice was smart enough to clear up their ambiguously labeled products.  Today's McFly FYI and word of the day is \"PURE\", and brought to you from my sponsor, \"Merriam Webster\": PURE : unmixed with any other matter. As in Gold, Pure Gold, Jerry. (I watch tv and commercials, does it show?)<br /><br />For an amazing ride courtesy of the \"short bus marketing team\" see the label here:<br />http://www.amazon.com/Lakewood-Organic-PURE-Carrot-Juice/dp/B0000ZSHAK<br />Click on the photo and zoom in to find the 1% of Einsteinian logic or lack there of.  Finding the PURE BS or at least 99.9% requires no zoom, matter of fact arms length, like in a grocery store aisle is close enough to be misdirected.<br /><br />Ok Lakewood, so, think what you will about my criticism be it glib, harsh, frank, curt or possibly even unfair or totally wrong.  On the other hand, I think not but I would love to be proven wrong.  Are you game for a little challenge: Get three 3rd graders, heck even three 3 year olds and give them each 3 crayons, green, yellow and orange.  Now ask them to draw a picture for the label of juice which contains, \"carrots and lemons\" or if your brave enough for a real acid test, \"lemons and carrots.\"  All I am saying, is give 3's a chance! In a world of scams, rip-offs and misconceptions and misdirection...be honest and be excellent to one another.<br /><br />No hard feelings, right?<br /><br />Ret Hink aka Curt Frank aka bombastic sarcastic B@5t@rD\n",

      "I love goat cheeses and buy them on a regular basis.  A lot of people seem unaware that there are many other types of goat cheese on the market other than the ultra fresh Chevre.  I have purchased this selection by iGourmet for both myself and for others as gifts.  The reactions from my friends have been mixed.  They all enjoy the harder chesses, such as the Goat Cheddar and the Ibores.  However, some people don't like fresh, soft goat chesses and one of the reasons that I send them this selection is so that they can try a variety of different chesses.  However, in the selection that I was sent it contained two versions of Chevre-type cheeses including the delicious Buche de Chevre.  Still, I wished they had more of the harder to find goat milk versions of cheeses traditionally made from cow's milk such as the goat's milk Cheddar and Gouda.<br /><br />As for as price goes, this is a surprisingly good value.  You are getting two pounds of very expensive chesses for a little more than I have paid for one pound of some of the varieties here.  One of my friends did receive a substitution for one of the chesses.  Instead of the cheddar they received the Cypress Grove's Midnight Moon.  I can certainly understand why substitutions would be necessary and I felt that they replaced the listed cheese with an even better variety.  Overall I am very pleased with both the price and the quality of the cheeses, I just wish that they had less fresh and more unique forms of this wonderful type of chesse.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1423603680\">Goat Cheese</a>\n",

      "Someone grabbing a bag of Veggie Straws may mistakenly believe Veggie Straws are made primarily of vegetables other than potatoes.  In fact, a quick read of the back of the bag reveals they are made primarily of potatoes and flavored with tomato and spinach.  This explains why they taste so much like potato chips.  The texture is light and crisp, and while it's been many years since I've had pork rinds, that's what I think of when I bite into these straws.<br /><br />Sensible Portions is the name of the company.  A 20 ounce bag contains 20 servings, which is about 38 straws.  Each serving has 7 grams of fat.  Compare that to <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0071BYOK8\">Frito Lay Baked! Ruffles Original Potato Crisps</a>, which contains only 3 grams of fat per 1 ounce serving.<br /><br />If you can overlook the fat content, Veggie Straws are actually quite tasty, and they do have that psychological edge with that name.

      "We have a 3 year old Maltese that we used to shower with Greenies (1-2 a day) even though it says to limit them to one per day.  The last time we took him to the vet, we told her what kind of food he's on and what kind of treats he gets.  She was concerned with the amount of Greenies he gets and told us to limit them to one every other day.  She said that Greenies contain wheat and that could be problematic for dogs later on in life.  So I searched on Amazon for a wheat free dental chew...<br /><br />Our dog has tried three different kinds of dental chews (including this one) and likes them all.  He's tried <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G96UK8\">Greenies Dental Chews for Dogs, Teenie Pack, 96 Chews</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MWRT18\">Zuke's Z-Ridge Mini - Carrot Fresh Breath Dental Chew Bones, 15 Count Pouch</a>.<br /><br />After reading mixed reviews, I decided to give these a try.  My first impressions were that these were pretty large for a \"small\" dog.  They are twice the length of a Greenie.  When our little guy got one, he ate half of it, then tried to hide the other half.  He did like it though.  I will say that he usually devours his Greenies but he takes his time on these (he did the same with the Zukes at first).  After a few days, he seems to really like them.<br /><br />If you're doing a side by side comparison between the Get Naked dental chew, Greenies and Zukes,  I think these are better.  They're really low in calories and they're wheat free, corn free, soy free and gluten free.  They're cheaper than Zukes as well.<br /><br />My recommendation is to cut them in half.  That will give you 36 treats for your dog per bag.  Three bags will give you 108 treats vs. Greenies 96 at around the same price.  He likes the Zukes but they are just too expensive seeing how you only get 15 per bag.<br /><br />I suggest buying one bag to see if your dog likes them.  If they do, then they are a great alternative to Greenies.\n",

Fruit Punch, Orange Tangerine, and Watermelon Strawberry have the highest calories, 140; Kiwi Berry is next, 135; Black Cherry is next, 130; and Grape has the lowest, 125.  Orange Tangerine and Watermelon Strawberry have the highest total carbohydrates, 36g; Black Cherry and Fruit Punch are next, 35g; Kiwi Berry is next, 34g; and Grape has the lowest, 33g. Finally Watermelon Strawberry has the highest sugars, 35g; Fruit Punch and Orange Tangerine are next, 34g; Black Cherry and Kiwi Berry are next, 33g, and Grape is the lowest, 32g.<br /><br />Note: all of these are fruit juice blends so those with fruit juice health concerns need to be aware of more than just the title juice. All contain acerola, apple, and grape juice. In addition to their title juices Kiwi Berry contains raspberry and strawberry, and Fruit Punch contains cherry, lemon, and pineapple.  Orange Tangerine also contains soy.<br /><br />Compare and Contrast: a similar product is worth considering: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYY1E\">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Apple, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYXYW\">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Blackberry, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014X5O1C\">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Clementine, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYXTC\">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Grapefruit, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYXQK\">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Pomegranate, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.

      "Silly me, I didn't read the packaging terribly closely. I was actually rather pleasantly surprised. Basically, it's carbonated fruit juice from concentrate, or as they say: \"100% juice (filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates, apple, grape, tangerine, orange and acerola [cherry] juice concentrates).\"<br /><br />Gone is the usual second ingredient in such beverages: \"high fructose corn syrup\" or the old standby \"sugar\"...<br /><br />Basically, it reminds me of a carbonated version of Tropicana Pure or one of the Odwalla beverages, watered down just slightly (not quite as sugary, but still pretty darned sweet).<br /><br />Overall, I rather liked it. It's a bit smaller than your typical Pepsi or Coca-cola can. But I could see it being handy for kids' lunches and such. Slightly better than typical \"soda\" with corn syrup. Though I'm not sure whether it would be preferable to straight up fruit juice...<br /><br />Personally, I'd rather have the fruit juice (like a Hansen's smoothie or something, granted they're a bit sugarier)... But some folks like carbonated beverages. So, why not make one out of actual fruit juices rather than all sorts of more artificial stuff?<br /><br />Rather liked the Orange Tangerine one. I'm interested now to try some of the other flavors and see if they're as good. Especially <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH40\">Kiwi Berry</a>...

It has a really strong after taste and despite being \"100% juice\" it tastes like bad artificial Orange flavoring.<br /><br />I'd opt for the grape or the black cherry for sure. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG940E\">The Switch Black Cherry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a><br /><br />Also, you'll want to note that The Switch sodas aren't exactly healthy, they are simply not overrun with artificial flavors. They actually have a fairly high calorie count. That being said they have some health benefits over pop- like the vitamin count and no added sugars.\n",

Basically the drink has minimal carbonation, and a light orange juice flavor with hints of rind/zest.  Undertones of grape and apple come across as well being that they are ingredients but I still feel this beverage is distinctly orange.  Compared to the cherry which I tried earlier I feel that this is a far more refreshing drink.  Personally I find this drink to be rather good and fans of Orangina should definitely take note.\n",

      "I did not find this drink anything special in terms of taste; it is orange juice infused with carbonation. The juice is quite acidic and you don't feel that there is 100% fruit juice. The drink comes in cans rather than glass bottle which would have helped the drink maintain the juicy taste longer. It does not have any preservatives and it is gluten free, no sugar and no artificial flavors. This drink doesn't have any special features and it doesn't stand out well in a market crowded with many drinks.<br /><br />1. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYXQK\">IZZE Fortified Sparkling Juice, Pomegranate, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a><br />2. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q3ECXM\">Minute Maid Mixed Berry Juice, 24 - 10 fl oz Bottles, 240 fl oz</a><br />3.

      "The Switch bills itself as \"great tasting healthy alternative to soda\" so I decided to see for myself. The first thing I wanted to do was compare it's nutritional facts against my favorite orange soda and this is how they matched up:<br /><br />The Switch Orange Tangerine (Per Serving)<br />16.97 Calories<br />1.8 mg Sodium<br />4.3 g Carb<br />4.1 g Sugar<br />20% RDA Vitamin A<br />100% RDA Vitamin C<br /><br />National Brand Orange Soda (Per Serving)<br />15.8 Calories<br />3.7 mg Sodium<br />4.3 g Carb<br />4.3 g Sugar<br /><br />Besides slightly less sodium, the addition of vitamins and no added sugars <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG945O\">The Switch Orange Tangerine, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> didn't really stand out as a winner based on nutritional facts alone. So when it came to drinking it, I had expected to prefer the more natural taste that The Switch might offer.  Unfortunately the main two juices used in this drink are Apple and Grape and that left me not tasting the \"Orange Tangerine\" as much as I had wanted.<br /><br />Overall when comparing the two beverages not only did it not impress me with taste or nutrition, but add on the obvious price difference ($.03 per ounce vs. $.11 per ounce) and The Switch won't be causing me to switch. I'm happy to stick with my good old orange soda.\n",

This has just the right touch of natural sweetness, and the tangerine gives a nice little tang to the orange flavor. Reminds me of the great orange sodas you can get in Europe or specialty shops, like <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GN4OHK\">Orangina Sparkling Citrus Beverage with Natural Pulp - 24 Cans</a> or <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001FQUCG\">San Pellegrino Aranciata 6 pack - 6oz bottles</a>.<br /><br />Dare I say it?

      "As part of Amazon's Vine Program I received two trial cans of The Switch, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG940E\">Black Cherry</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG945O\">Orange Tangerine</a>. I tried both flavors cold (over ice) and rated them 4 stars each, although I prefer the Orange Tangerine flavor to the Black Cherry.<br /><br />Whether or not The Switch is just right or not sweet enough for you will depend on your personal experience with carbonated juice drinks and soda. If you are looking for the sweetness and fizz of a diet soda you will be disappointed. These are 100% juice drinks. The Orange Tangerine flavor has 140 calories and the Black Cherry has 130 calories.<br /><br />I recommend them as an alternative to regular juice to liven up your lunch or help you refuel after a workout. Either way, you are getting 100% of your Vitamin C and there's no added sugar or corn syrup, no preservatives and no artifical colors.<br /><br />The Black Cherry flavor was too mild for me. I was looking for more bite. I could taste hints of the apple, grape and acerola juice concentrates in the blend. The flavor reminded me of blends I've tasted from Treetop. Again, The Switch has a lot less carbonation than you would find in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYXYW\">Izze Fortified All Natural Sparkling Blackberry Juice</a>, for example.<br /><br />The Orange Tangerine flavor should be renamed the Tangerine Orange flavor to reflect the dominate taste and aroma. The Switch's blend is as flavorful as <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BDHBWQ\">essn Sparkling Minneola Tangerine Juice</a> or <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001L4EME4\">San Pellegrino Orange</a> although, again, it is no where near as carbonated as those other brands.<br /><br />In summary, these all natural, 100% juice drinks are a healthier option than drinking a soda. The Switch also can help break up the monotony of drinking plain water and/or juice after a workout. Remember to keep them the cans ice cold, though. Preferably, serve them on the rocks.<br /><br />BTW: If you are looking for a full-flavored Black Cherry soda, try <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001P9GB4Y\">Thomas Kemper Black Cherry Soda</a>, which has 170 calories per bottle. There's a low calorie (10) version as well but it isn't available on Amazon.\n",

      "Note: This is my first review of a product that is not a book, so please forgive me if I miss something.<br /><br />I'm not a huge fan of fruit drinks like The Switch, but I decided to go ahead and give it a shot. After having my first drink, I can honestly say I wanted to hate it. I mean, seriously, I'm drinking this can of 100% fruit juice with carbonation and reading all these really stupid quotes all over the can (i.e. \"100% of what I want in a soda, 0% of what I don't\"), wondering how much a 8.3 ounce can of this junk costs (thinking somewhere in the neighborhood of $2.50 or $3.00; and thinking, if I wanted to drink some juice and would drink some juice! I couldn't stop thinking about what is so special about carbonation that I would want to drink this over a glass of OJ. I wanted to scream!<br /><br />However, I kept my cool, and finished the drink. There was something about this particular flavor that was enjoyable, but not engrossing. There was something in the aftertaste that I did not like, and I think it had to do with the tangerine juice. Tangerine's aren't my bag, either; but it was tolerable.<br /><br />After discussing this product with my wife (I know, this drink apparently also contains the conversation starter attributes, bonus points for that I suppose) she was like, \"this sounds great. Is it like those <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IW25RK\">Izze POMEGRANATE SPARKLING 100% JUICE DRINK</a>??\" I responded: \"Um.... I guess so...\"<br /><br />I then also looked up the price and learned that I had grossly overestimated the price of a single can (being just over a single dollar). Despite my wanting to hate this product, I've decided to step out of my anti-contemporary culture box, view this product for what it is, and give it a middle rating of 3 stars.<br /><br />I can see the attraction; I can see the appeal; I just won't ever buy it. I'll stick to my glass of Orange Juice and Tang any day.<br /><br />Good drinking,<br /><br />J.Stoner\n",

      "Index: 6825\n",
      "The first sip gave a pleasing flavor burst with a light tang of carbonation.  When testing the black cherry flavor, I had placed the can in the freezer for a short period, since I prefer drinks to be ice cold or hot; I didn't want lukewarm to get in the way of a positive response to the first sip.  As the drink warmed a bit, the sweetness overtook the carbonation, which is inevitable in a carbonated beverage, yet, due to the purity of the fruit base, the flavor remained true and welcome.<br /><br />When trying the kiwi flavor, I just had the drink chilled perfectly for me, no ice crystals.  I like the kiwi even better than the cherry!  The kiwi has more tang.  See below (or on the product description on the buying page) for the juice blends used.  I've noticed that most juices currently have apple and grape included, likely because those are cheaper to produce.<br /><br />The way the drink was promoted wasn't a lie!  It worked for me:<br /><br />1. \"100 % of what you want.  0% of what you don't want.\"<br /><br />2. \"Make The Switch to a great tasting, all natural beverage that's the perfect balance between JUICE and CARBONATION.\"<br /><br />3. The logo has \"THE\" placed upside-down and reversed, atop \"Switch,\" with a swirl designed around the words, the swirl imitating the symbol for reversing something.<br /><br />4. The ingredients read: \"100% juice (filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates, apple, grape, kiwi, acerola* [I added the asterisk; see below] and raspberry and strawberry juice concentrated), natural flavors, ascorbic acid (vitamin C)\"<br /><br />5. 100% juice carbonated.<br /><br />6. The can is smaller than the norm for soda pops, which I also liked, because when I used to drink sodas regularly, I usually opened a can and left half of it to get too warm (and fizzed out), so the remainder went down the drain (after I returned it to the fridge for a few days hoping I might drink it).  I drank the whole can of Black Cherry!<br /><br />I decided I liked the near slush state of a short stint in the freezer... leaving it too long, though, might cause too much separation of the fruit concentrate from the fizz water... and, of course, makes it undrinkable from the can until it melts enough to flow through the hole in the top.<br /><br />In the past, when I had begun wanting something more natural than most soda beverages (with phosphates, etc., added), I had used frozen orange juice concentrate added to Club Soda or Ginger ale.  It didn't take long to feel that the process was too much trouble (and it was more expensive than the cost of the Switch product).  Also, I like the types of fruits Switch is using.<br /><br />At first I was confused at the acerola* ingredient, not knowing what it was.  Since my <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00154JDAI\">Kindle 2: Amazon's New Wireless Reading Device (Latest Generation)</a> was at hand, as always, I looked up acerola in the onboard dictionary.  The word wasn't in there, so I pushed the curser to the right, on the arrow for more types of searches, and used my standby, Google, and found several listings of acerola.<br /><br />Briefly, I found that it's thought to have originated from the Yucatan, and is known as Barbados cherry or wild crape myrtle, a tropical fruit-bearing shrub.  Reading into the variety of praiseworthy qualities of that cherry, I was impressed!  It has 32 times the amount of vitamin C as Orange juice, and many other healthful assets.  If you're interested in details, feel free to go Google.<br /><br />I'm beginning to think that many of the flavors available from Switch will include equally intriguing tropical fruits.  (I was glad to see that other flavors also have acerola in them).<br /><br />Though the can is appealing and fine, this beverage is good enough to deserve a designer bottle to appeal to the gourmet crowd who want flavor without true health issues... don't get me started on the myriad of heavy promotions of pseudo health issues.  I have a book in progress to be published on KINDLE, which will debut with steam hissing out of Kindle's ears, at no extra charge!  (I'll add a comment to this review about why I had quit drinking soda pops, which will explain why I will be happily able to welcome Switch into my diet.)<br /><br />My thanks to THE SWITCH for providing a healthy, gourmet quality drink... WITHOUT, thank God, SOYBEANS added!!<br /><br />I'm hooked!<br /><br />Linda Shelnutt<br />Author of several Kindle books and Amazon Shorts<br /><br />P.S.<br />With chagrin and apologies I've had to add comment updates here\n",

I prefer the Izze of the 3.  As for the juice, it's more apple/grape than orange/tangerine & the Vit. C is the silly recommended dose--to prevent scurvy--not much really (per Linus Pauling).  True, it doesn't have corn syrup/sugar/or substitutes--which is nice.  But, at close to $1/8.3 oz it's equivalent to about $1.50 for 12 oz (in a pack of 24 small cans).

It just doesn't add anything to the taste or consistency that I found enjoyable.  It also left a lengthy aftertaste of juice burps which I did not enjoy.

      "The Healthy 'n Fit egg protein is a very good product. It's almost all protein, the taste is good, you can cook with it (my favorites are oatmeal and Russian-style cottage cheese pancakes). And the price *used* to be great, even cheaper per ounce than the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GIST86\">Optimum Nutrition 100% Egg Protein, Rich Chocolate, 2 Pound</a>. However, since I bought my first tub earlier this year, the price jumped significantly to more than the Optimum Nutrition chocolate-flavored egg protein, so I bought a 2-lb. tub of that. I found that while the ON protein has a little fat and more carbs in it, it was much easier to mix into liquids with fewer or no clumps, unlike the Healthy 'n Fit product. I also like the taste just fine. So I found that I enjoy my shakes with the ON more, and it's faster and easier to mix my oatmeal in the morning with the ON.<br /><br />Please don't get me wrong -- this is a great product.

      "Behind the 12 packets of Via instant coffee, Starbucks placed a brief message, \"Never be without.\" That's a better marketing strategy than, say, \"You could do worse.\" Instant coffee is still instant coffee and no one who starts his or her day with a cup of Joe is about to trade fresh brew or French press for instant.<br /><br />In a pinch, Via is a portable and affordable option.<br /><br />However, I don't recommend Via as a strategy to save money on your coffee bill. A quality coffee press and a thermos will do much better. The 12-packet order currently sells for $8.95 on Amazon, without special offers or subscribe-and-save discounts. That works out to $0.75 per cup, which is about what you'd expect to pay in a standard vending machine. Hands down, Starbucks Via tastes better than anything pouring out of a vending machine. However, each Via stick produces an 8-ounce cup of coffee so, depending which size you normally order, you might spend $1.50 (for 16 ounces) or $2.25 (for 24 ounces).<br /><br />At $0.75 per 8-ounce cup, Starbucks' Via sticks are the same price as SoloBrew's <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QTJ70M\">French Press To-Go SoloPress</a>, which I also reviewed on Amazon.com.

I initially settled on Newman's Own Dark Roast as my \"go-to\" coffee, but I didn't stop there.  I like to keep experimenting and looking for something new.  I happened to find Coffee People's Organic Extra Bold blend and was blown away.  It has been my favorite ever since I first tried it.  Last week I saw a listing for a Colombian dark roast sold under the Wolfgang Puck name (it is processed and distributed by Van Houtte) and decided to give it try.  Here is my impression of it:<br /><br />After brewing a cup (I used the 7 1/2 oz. setting) the first thing that I noticed was that it didn't have that freshly-brewed aroma that the Coffee People X-Bold does, however the taste was another story.  It hits your palate with medium acidity and a nice, sharp bite that gets your attention right away. The finish was surprising clean with a hint of spice (nutmeg or cinnamon?) and just a slight, lingering, pleasant bitterness.  I really like this coffee but I think that I will stick with Coffee People's Extra Bold and this will be my back-up brand.  However, I will keep looking for something new.

Very low in acidity, someone who can't tolerate the acidity in coffee may be able to enjoy this blend.

I bought three Wolfgang Puck coffees several months ago: Rodeo Drive Blend; French Roast; and Sumatra Kopi Raya. All three are quite drinkable, though they do not measure up to a few of the extra-bold blends from Coffee People: Kona Blend; Organic Blend; Jet Fuel; and Black Tiger. Even better than these, though, is my new favorite, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003M7TTYG\">Green Mountain's Revv</a>. Those who prefer a strong, dark cup of coffee (even at the larger mug setting) should try that brand.<br /><br />Previously, I had found the dark-roast Green Mountain coffees rather boring, but Revv lives up to the hype, both in strength and flavor. Another great Green Mountain coffee is their Espresso Blend (though Amazon doesn't stock it, so the prices tend to be higher here than in brick-and-mortar stores such as Bed Bath and Beyond). Finally, a favorite regular over the years has been <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M5W7YQ\">Emeril's Big Easy Bold</a>.

To them so confused I ask<br /><br />Cooking?<br /><br />Each day at least once a day, I draw forth my serrated knife, and one sacrificial box of this excellent tofu, and I without remorse slice a hole in its top, with great tenderness and care and gratitude, releasing only the slightest and most apologetic gentle spurt of clearest liquid.<br /><br />And this with a certain yearning.<br /><br />I do not observe the indications written sternly upon the short edge of the box, but lie this box gently down upon a smooth flat slab of wood, with the face up, and take the knife very gently sliding upon on edge of the top, the very belly of the box, and then upon the other edge of this top, and then most gently along the bottom edge of this top, each time releasing apologetically the slightest hint of a clear liquid, revealing thusly by means of these three slits the gentle hidden secrets of the box, the soft white substance lying shyly within, awaiting with embarrassment our further processing.<br /><br />I feel the need to explain this procedure with greater care and attention. The very tip, the point of the knife, uncovers tenderly a certain point a certain distance from the corner of the broad top of the box, the side with the picture and product label, as pictured here, the side which reads Morinu, the broad flat side laid flat. The very tip of the knife, I say, discovers probingly a certain point near one corner which offers the proper resistance without too great a resistance, without too little a resistance, to penetrate this membrane. Too close to the corner is found to be too hard, too resistant, too unwilling, although most convenient for the later proceedings. Too distant from the corner implies simply random slashings without specific purpose, and our purpose in this procedure is most serious, most purposeful, intent.<br /><br />In a word therefore the point of the knife penetrates the membrane slowly yet purposefully as close to the corner as possible, penetrating as deeply as possible without piercing the wooden slab beneath. A certain spurt of clear liquid may emerge, but let this prove no inhibition, as the knife reaches the depth of the box. Slowly withdraw the knife, slowly, at a diagonal, allowing the serration softly with friction to continue to separate a slight slit along the ege of the box, slowly, resolutely but patiently, with purpose, as the serration creates an ever longer slit along that edge, as closely as possible.<br /><br />Continue from this first slit along the the contiguous edge of the top of this box, and then the third edge, inserting carefully your knife, and slowly withdrawing with a friction sufficient to separate the membrane without shredding, without eliciting over muchly the clear liquid which may spurt forth.<br /><br />Let us call the top right corner of the box Point A, the bottom right corner Point B, the left bottom corner Point C and the upper left corner Point D. Begin to pierce at Point A, proceed in turn to B, to C, ending at D, forming this a slit along the three edges. Arriving at Point D, withdraw the knife completely, wipe the blade with a soft, dry cloth and set it aside for cleansing. We now may lift the flap thus created, exposing the delicate white contents within.<br /><br />I feel remiss if I do not address a probable misconception here writtenonly for the rhetorical convenience, and I feel compelled by the necesity of correcting this counter-indication, no matter how unclear this may be, due only to my severely limiting literary incapacities.<br /><br />Employing the same alphabetical coordinates as described above, the consumer may discover this procedure far more efficacious: to begin at Point A and proceed gently yet firmly to point B as described. Divergently, however, please proceed to point D (!) and then directly by knife edge to point C, parallel to the Line AB already created, yet along the opposing edge. Having thusly formed two parallel slits, find the midpoint between Point B and Point C as close to the edge as possible, probing and then plunging the tip of the knife through the cardboard membrane, through to the bottom of the box, but now with an orientation perpendicular to that previously used in the formation of lines AB and DC. Withdraw slowly, delicately, yet with sufficient friction at an angle to proceed effectively to the corner at Point B. Withdraw completely and reverse the knife blade, returning it deeply at the midpoint previously entered. Withdraw once more with similar care, and opposite diagonal, completing the slit thus formed entirely to Point C. I am confident the consumer may discover this procedure far more delightful and effective than any here previously described.<br /><br />Firmly we roll back the top flap created by the three slits. Proceed mercilessly, proceed, not frenetically, but ardently nevertheless, to dice within the selfsame box her contents, slowly, gently, but decisively. The fresh tip of my serrated knife, which in recent memory has touched no animal part, but vegetable alone, and never shall become so adulterate with the blood of the animal, with the dairy of the animal, this sanctified and reserved and faithful tip, having never known in any sense animal but only vegetable, purified thus, unadulterate, this sacred knife dares therefore pierce this gentle pure white tofu into a ruthless grid of slits, fully through to the bottom box, plunging first vertically in rhythmically repeated rows spaced gently a few centimeters apart, and then, relentlessly, horizontally, pushing ever so softly through the yielding, unresisting white tofu laid back upon the flat slab, awaiting without a word this process, with utter patience, yielding.<br /><br />Completed this repeated slicing, back and forth, up and down, across, and through, and through, I lift in one hand upwards the entire box gently, yet unrelentingly, over the recipient reserved for this purpose alone. Most often it is the daily lunch container, reusable, with soft top, to receive the more securely and gently this daily offering, removed demurely from its box, as cautiously as a hermit crab from its borrowed shell, vulnerable by exposure. With one finger one may remove whatever residue remains relunctly within the package, passing it reassuringly into the ultimate recipient.<br /><br />Lime juice freshly squeezed upon the tofu deposited there, as ablution, meets fragrant sprigs of fresh green cilantro mated with whole <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JMFCRU\">Corriander Seeds 7oz</a>, and a generous ladling of the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GZU7QQ\">Eden Organic Garbanzo Beans, 15-Ounce Unit (Pack of 12)</a> also available upon this generously nutrient amazon. This is a meal in itself, and comes most welcome at noon.<br /><br />At night rather than such a cold lunch, in this cold winter a warmer meal is wanted, and so this gentle and yielding box of nutritious tofu might discover herself pushed gently into a saucepan of simmering miso soup, such as, perhaps, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RMB4WI\">Shiro Miso Paste NON GMO No MSG Added</a>. This miso soup would take far greater space to describe here in the making. From this container of miso paste draw forth a goodly spoonful to introduce slowly, most politely, into a gently heating small saucepan of water. Later, in place of seaweed and to deceive my own palate, I place those small flat spinach leaves available in the organic department of your local market, perhaps with the results of a small onion diced very carefully in the manner approved as described above, or green onion.<br /><br />When quite ready for dinner, I add last of all to this essence this gentle box of tofu, sliced as described above, with great and tender care, leaving it bathing one might dare say, only long enough to warm through and through, before eating.<br /><br />A veritable meal in itself.<br /><br />There are so many other manners in which to use, and to abuse, this pure, white and utterly nutritious gentle product, and I can only with my utmost recommendation say, and this with my greatest gratitude, that here at long last we may know a food most willingly fit for our human consumption, and one most readily available upon this wonderful amazon.\n",

Among his daily treats are Greenies and since we found these on Amazon, Zuke's Jerky Naturals.  I will say that we tried two different kinds.  Along with these, we tried the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MLKXOU\">Wellness WellBites Chicken and Venison Recipe Dog Treats, 8-Ounce Pouch</a>.<br /><br />The Zuke's are really potent.  When you open the bag, you catch a big whiff of how strong they are.  They're probably real flavorful because of it (I didn't try one).  The Wellness treats seem a little dryer.  While our little guy likes both of the treats, the Zuke's win over the Wellness.  Plus they're cheaper so that's even better.  He can't get enough of them.<br /><br />We also tried the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MWRT18\">Zuke's Z-Ridge Mini - Carrot Fresh Breath Dental Chew Bones, 15 Count Pouch</a> made by Zuke's.  He doesn't like those as much as the Greenies.<br /><br />I would say that this product is one of the best we found for our dog.  Plus we were able to take advantage of the free super saver shipping as well.  These are highly recommended.<br /><br />[Edit: August 14, 2011]<br /><br />He still loves them!<br /><br />We've had to start giving our little guy Remedel for a little shoulder injury he had.  These Zukes make it real easy to give him the pill.  Since they're moist, we just put the pill inside and press it all around the pill.  That way he doesn't even know he's taking it.  Trying to give him pills with the Wellness treats doesn't work so well since they're dryer.<br /><br />[Edit: September 29, 2012]<br /><br />Anyone else notice that they seem different??  The last couple packs we bought were dryer and brittle.  They also weren't as potent as the other ones were.  He doesn't seem to like them as much any more.  I don't know if the bags we bought were partially opened so they dried out by the time the were delivered or if their recipe changed.  I'll buy some more and see how they turn out.

I give my dog soft treats because he doesn't chew the damn things, and he choked on these horrible things; I had to toss them out.<br /><br />Note that the \"Zuke's Jerky Naturals\" with the other packaging (http://www.amazon.com/Zukes-Jerky-Naturals-Beef/dp/B00008DFPY) have always been moist and soft, and I've never had a problem with those.

After we tried the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LXYA5Q\">Miracle Berry Fruit Tablets</a>tablet, there was a small difference for both of us.  For me, the bitterness subsided a small amount-- not even enough to worth mentioning.  For her, the grapefruit tasted like one of the \"sweetest\" ones she'd ever had.<br /><br />However, the real treat for both of us came with the lemons and limes.  Both of which tasted noticeably better.  However, the effect of a single tablet wore off completely within 5 minutes.  To be honest, I hoped each tablet would last closer to an hour, but as is, you're paying quite a bit per minute for these things (we paid ~$20 for ten tablets w/ shipping).<br /><br />Would I try it again?  After the tablets we have left are finished, I think not.  I already enjoy gala apples, bananas, watermelon, oranges, and strawberries without this tablet-- I can live a perfectly happy life without ever eating grapefruit, lemons or limes DIRECTLY (lemon and lime are fine in foods).<br /><br />If you're dead-set on trying these tablets, try it with some of your friends, but don't expect too much.\n",

      "We breastfeed our month old boy, but since his bilirubin level was still high, doctors recommended to switch to formula for 48 hours. We started with Similac Advance (Shield Plus) which we still had from hospital. First 24 hours were wonderful in terms of pooping, then we decided to switch to Similac Organic for known reasons, but during the first 32-Ounce Bottle I began to notice that his stool was getting harder, and eventually he stopped pooing (actually he produced two stone-ball like poops) and had a hard time for another 24 hours. Breast milk and Similac advance tested similarly sweet, but Similac Organic was much much less sweet. I made a research on the internet and I found the following that may help you to understand the cause of constipation: (http://www.drhull.com/EncyMaster/C/constipation_infant.html)<br /><br />Constipation means infrequent, hard stools. It does not mean grunting or straining, although your baby may certainly exhibit these behaviors when having a bowel movement. So the first question to ask is, \"Is my child really constipated?\"<br /><br />Next, consider why true constipation - excessively hard, dry stools - arises. The normal function of the colon is to remove water from the stool. Otherwise we would rapidly dehydrate and die. That is why severe diarrhea is dangerous - the stool is moving through the colon and being expelled from the body so fast, there is no time to properly reabsorb the stool water back into the bloodstream.<br /><br />Conversely, if the fecal material remains in the colon too long, the water removal process may extract too much of the fecal water and leave the stool mass excessively dry and hard. It is just that simple.<br /><br />So constipation arises when feces remain in the colon too long because:<br /><br />  * the colon is naturally sluggish (has decreased \"motility,\" we say)<br />  * a low residue diet produces insufficient stimulation to the colon to trigger its normal propulsive activity and clear out the feces<br />  * a combination of the above two factors<br />  * there is obstruction of the lower GI tract<br />  o functional neurologic - the lower rectum and anus cannot properly relax to allow evacuation - Hirschprung disease<br />  o functional anatomic - anal-rectal positioning doesn't allow easy evacuation<br />  o mechanical - a tumor physically blocks stool passage<br /><br />Breast fed babies are essentially never truly constipated. This is because breast milk is such a low residue diet. Almost all of the milk is absorbed by the baby and used. The stools consist of a small amount of unabsorbed protein curds and a large amount of bowel secretions, chiefly mucus. And of course a lot of noisy gas. But these infrequent stools do not indicate constipation - just infrequent stools.<br /><br />Later, when breast feeding infants start solids, they technically can become constipated, but it is unusual in my experience. It is not until the child is pretty much on solids and especially when weaned to whole cow milk that constipation is much of an issue. By then we are really discussing toddlers.<br /><br />Breast fed infants do tend to save up after the first few months and poop less often. This worries some parents. Despite reassurances to the contrary, some folks just have to see a poop every day from their little darling to be happy and fulfilled. Go figure. They forget that stool can stay in the colon for a very, very long time and it will not hurt anything.<br /><br />When the stool hoarding breast feeder does finally get ready to go, another problem comes to the fore: grunting and straining. When the baby's rectum forms in utero, it is in a state of permanent contraction for nigh onto nine months. The baby does not pass the meconium (fetal stool) in utero until perhaps right at the end of gestation right before, during or after delivery. Until the baby is several months old, and has passed and been stretched by quite a few bowel movements, the rectum and particularly the anus may be quite tight and resist easy dilation to allow the stool to pass. Because the baby has weak, flabby abdominal musculature (that is why his little tummy is so poochy), he must push against this tight anal spincter with his diaphragm. Just as Mom pushed during delivery, and with seemingly equal discomfort. Hence the grunting and red-faced straining.<br /><br />  The other major problem of both breast or bottle fed newborns which creates this sort of straining is dyschezia, or uncoordinated stooling.<br /><br />The cure for the problem of a tight anus is pretty simple: a gentle rectal exam with a well-lubricated pinky finger by the doctor (which should be done on all babies with stooling troubles anyway to rule out a physical obstruction) will be both diagnostic and curative. If one such gentle dilation doesn't do the trick, I have Mom bring the baby back in a week and repeat the procedure. The anal spincter is stretched, and pretty soon, no more terrible straining.<br />Top<br /><br />Bottle fed infants are \"a whole 'nother story.\" Infant formulas are not nearly as well digested as breast milk, and leave quite a bit more residue in the colon. (The exception to this rule in my mind is the new Similac® that really does seem to leave the stools about the same consistency as breast milk.) So true constipation in bottle fed infants is much more common; my feeling is that soy formulas are even worse than cow milk based formulas in this regard.<br /><br />The young infant's colon is simply not designed for all the residue and stool bulk. The residue builds up, is dried too much, and becomes hard, pebbly stool. It is naturally difficult and uncomfortable for the baby to pass.<br /><br />The addition of cereal to the diet only compounds whatever problems already exist. Cereal + milk = concrete. Cereal in the formula bottle seems to be especially bad, probably because parents don't realise just how much cereal the baby is getting.<br />Top<br /><br />Treatment of constipation mainly involves common sense diet modifications and sometimes medication:<br /><br />  * Again, as with breast fed babies, a search for the cause of the constipation and gentle rectal exam can work wonders.<br />  * I use a lot of Karo® corn syrup for bottle feeders with constipation. It is my first choice recomendation; it almost always works if used properly. Unfortunately, many doctors and nurses don't use it properly, get poor results, and don't recommend it as often as they should. I start with two measuring teaspoons in every formula bottle, regardless of size, and adjust the dose up or down depending on how things are going. Usually, the baby can be weaned off the Karo pretty soon, but may need to stay on it periodically for the first few months of life. It is very important to put the corn syrup in the formula and not give it in between in water. The excess corn syrup does not get digested very well - the baby is already digesting all the sugar he can from the formula. The excess sugar passes down to the colon and produces a sugar diarrhea similar to sorbitol (as below, prunes, apple juice).<br /><br />  Before scolding me about \"the risk of botulism\" from corn syrup, please see:<br /><br />  Clinical Pediatric Emergency Medicine, Volume 4,Number 3,September 2003: \"Pediatric neurologic potpourri: cases to remember\"<br /><br />  \"In the past, C. botulinum was also found in corn syrup, but this is no longer a risk factor for infant botulism because of a recent change in the processing formula.\"<br /><br />  For the complete source of statement, see: Olsen SJ, Swerdlow DL. Risk of infant botulism from corn syrup. In reply. Pediatr Infect Dis J 2000;19:584-5.<br /><br />  * Certain fruits and juices - for example prunes, apple juice, apricots - are rich in sorbitol, a nondigestible sugar that passes through the body to the colon and causes water to be retained or drawn into the stool mass. They can be increased in the diet to loosen the stool and relieve or prevent constipation.<br />  * Lactulose is a non-absorbable sugar product that is processed by colon bacteria to produce an inflow of water into the stool mass. We use it a lot - it seems to be a favorite of our local pediatric gastroenterologists. The dose is adjusted up or down according to respose. Side effects are usually not serious but can include cramping or diarrhea - obviously, stop the medicine and call your doctor if these occur.<br />  * Glycerine suppositories are helpful to relieve your child if there is some hard stool that just won't come out easily. The suppository melts in the heat of the rectum and lubricates the stool. Glycerine also has a mild effect of attracting water into the stool, which softens it. The act of insertion also serves to stimulate the rectum and anus to initiate the defecation reflex. (Glycerine is completely safe - it is a food, found in candy, not a drug.)<br />  * Fiber containing foods are helpful for older children and adults, but are not really of much use in the treatment of young infant constipation, for dietary reasons: babies just don't eat a lot of fiber. (I believe ISoyalac®, which was a high fiber soy formula, has been discontinued. It was never very available any place I practiced, anyway.)<br /><br />Top<br /><br />Myths and misconceptions concerning infant constipation:<br /><br />  * Iron in the formula causes constipation. No way. I can understand lay people thinking this to be the case because when adults take iron preparations (in large doses) they may become constipated. But the tiny amount present in infant formula is not nearly enough to cause any problems.<br /><br />  The irritating thing to me is to hear doctors and nurses who should know better repeating this nonsense and switching the infants to the less healthy low- or no-iron formulas.<br /><br />  * Increasing water in the diet is commonly recommended; it makes very little sense and demonstrates a failure to reflect on the basic physiologic cause of the overdry stool. The problem is too little water retention in the stool, not too little water in the body! Unless there is increased fiber or some chemical substance such as a sugar (Karo®, lactulose) to retain the water in the stool, excess water will simply wind up in the diaper as urine.<br /><br />Top\n",

I tried this, not really expecting the kids to like it, but it was a hit!  I was so in love with the aroma that I ate a serving myself--something I don't usually do when I make boxed mac'n'cheese.

Within 12 hours, all ants were gone. However, my latest infestation was not responding to Terro, in fact, they were eating the liquid up, but it wasn't killing the ants. My neighborhood Hardware Supply store told me that insects could become tolerant to certain pesticides. I found the \"Safer\" product, but was skeptical. Take off the spout cover and blast a fine white powder into the cracks or places where the ants are coming through. For me, it was under two long baseboards in the kitchen. Then I swept up the excess white powder into the cracks some more and cleaned the tile of any powder. It worked instantly. Any ants that even touched the powder immediately started to wiggle and die. I have a cat, so I cleaned any excess up carefully, so she cannot get any on her paws, as it is very toxic. It's as good as Boric Acid.<br /><br />This powder claims to kills Ants, Cockroaches, Earwigs, Silverfish, Crickets, Millipedes and Centipedes. I did notice that immediately after applying this product, Silverfish started to appear, evidently sensing the chemicals. Soon, they will be gone. Do check it out.

What a disappointment!  Blue Diamond has apparently seen fit to add much more maltodextrin and \"other natural flavors\", which I suspect cause the odd taste, thus ruining a fabulous product.<br /><br />I've been having a hard time finding the small cans of Blue Diamond \"Honey Roasted Almonds\" at the supermarkets, despite all the other flavors being carried.  It's as if Blue Diamond just, for some reason, *wants* this product to fail.  First they make it hard to get the canned version, then they completely change the taste of a great product and package it in a canister, using a name that is so similar that it contains all the same words, but without a hint that it's not the same product.<br /><br />I'd contact Blue Diamond and complain, but I already know that they never respond to customers despite having a contact link on their website.  In the past, I wrote to them when they test-marketed and then removed some wonderful silvered almonds (not \"slivered\" but silvered, as in almonds with a very light sugary coating);  when I wrote to ask, instead of appreciating my interest as a customer, they simply ignored me.<br /><br />So I'm offering this review as a warning to anyone else who might make the same mistake, and think that these almonds will be like the similarly-named canned \"Honey Roasted Almonds\" from the same company.

My mother, all her sisters, my grandmother, and all our friends considered Lipton Loose Tea to be TEA. There was no other for them.  I grew up thinking anything else was an \"off\" brand.  (Lipton Tea is America's favorite tea.)<br /><br />In the South most people make it sweet.  They add the sugar while it is hot so less sugar is required.  Now I prefer to use Splenda (SPLENDA No Calorie Sweetener Granular, 9.7-Ounce Resealable Bags (Pack of 2)) and lemon juice. This tea has a strong black-tea taste.  It is robust and pure.<br /><br />When I moved across the Mississippi River, I was shocked to discover that people in Louisiana drink their tea three times as strong as they do in Mississippi. I think one reason my people liked Lipton Loose Tea so much was that we had very little money and we had to make things go as far as possible.  It was always a good bargain.  Almost any kind of tea is an excellent bargain.<br /><br />Nutritonally it is outstanding.  It is a means of hydrating, which is considered important.  (Always hydrate responsibly:  don't drink too much! You would not want to drown.) Also it is an excellent source of flavonoids, which provide antioxidants. A glass of tea has about half as much caffeine as a cup of coffee.  Since the ingredients vary with different practices, it is difficult to estimate the amount of caffeine.<br />Some caffeine can help many people.<br /><br />On my blog, which you can find at Flavored with Love: Mary Lou's Family and Friends Can Cook, I talked about my mother's tea and all the spread she used to make when she took food to church for dinner on the grounds.  The name of the blog entry is \"Myrtle's Stuffed Eggs.\"<br /><br />About stains -- it is helpful to brush and polish your teeth immediately after enjoying this wonderful tea.  Also, you can clean glasses, pitchers, etc., with baking soda. One more tip is to drink with a straw to try to avoid getting so much of the liquid on your front teeth. (I do this, but I don't think it helps much.)<br /><br />I hope you found this review helpful.\n",

      "DESCRIPTION:<br />> Blue Diamond Roasted-Salted Almonds are moderately roasted with canola, safflower, or sunflower oil (but not oily or greasy), and lightly salted.  These are \"heart healthy\" oils which are actually good for you, as is the almond oil itself.  Roasted Salted Almonds are available in bags or small cans small.<br />> Blue Diamond Smokehouse Almonds are similar with wonderful smokey flavor.  At this time Smokehouse Almonds are available from Amazon only in 16 oz (and smaller) bags.<br />> I have not tried the \"lightly salted\" variety but I presume that they have almost no salt.<br /><br />CANS vs BAGS<br />Various types of Blue Diamond Almonds are available in bags or small cans.  The small cans (3 1/4\" in diameter by 2 3/8\" high) are very convenient and assure that the almonds stay fresh until openned, and afterward, because they don't stay \"openned\" long (it is easy to eat a whole can at one setting).  Arguably the bags more environmentally friendly, but you don't get much of a price break for the much cheaper packaging.  I prefer the convenience and freshness of the cans.<br /><br />EVALUATION: Excellent and flavorful.  Well roasted and crunchy.  I cannot decide which I like best: the Roasted Salted or the Smokehouse.  Although not oily, the roasting oil does effect the flavor.  Whether that's a good thing or not is a matter of individual tastes.  I happen to like the roasted-in-oil flavor.<br /><br />LESS ROASTED ALMONDS<br />If you prefer less-roasted almonds, roasted without added oil, consider <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001COJ85G\">Back To Nature California Almonds, Sea Salt Roasted, 11-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 3)</a><br /><br />UNROASTED ALMONDS<br />Unroasted almonds are available <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001COE1AI\">Back To Nature California Almonds, Unroasted & Unsalted, 11-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 3)</a> but beware that thorough roasting makes almonds more digestable.  Unroasted almonds are susceptable to fungus which can be carcinogenic.  While commercial domestic almonds sold in the US do not contain significant levels of cyanide, bitter almonds, (which have a much richer almond flavor, particular in baked goods).  Indeed natural almond extract is made from bitter almonds---artificial almond extract is safer.  Bitter almonds are sometimes illegally sold in the US and are often encountered in other countries, and do contain dangerous levels of cyanide when raw.  7-10 raw bitter almonds can kill a child.  Moreover, a child raised on raw almonds may conclude that raw peach pits (essentially a variety of almonds) are safe to eat---they are NOT.  The safest practice is NOT to eat unroasted almonds.\n",

No vinegar.  Only slightly salty.  With a mild nutty flavor.  To me, they most closely resemble ripe black olives---but milder.<br /><br />If you like olives but are on a low-salt diet, and perhaps mostly use them in salads, or even sliced on pizza, Lindsay Olives are terrific, as is the price.  For a delicious spread, microwave cream cheese for about 1 minute in a ~24 oz glass bowl (such as <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016MZPII\">Marinex 23.7-Ounce Small Round Casserole with Lid</a>) to soften it, then mix-in coarsely chopped Lindsay Green Ripe olives.  To make a dip, add a tablespoon of milk and mix.<br /><br />For snacking, or as a light meal with cheese and fruit, Lindsay Pitted Ripe Green Olvies are a faint shadow of the truly wonderful genre of \"California ripe green olives\".  Unfortunately, the only brand you are likely to find outside California is Grabers olives,<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P8HPCI\">Graber Olives Size 14 7.5 oz. Can</a>.  Grabers are the Rolls Royce of ripe green olives, and are priced accordingly. About $1.50 per olive including shipping to the East Coast, perhaps $1 per olive if you buy them by the case directly from Grabers.  What's the difference?  Bigger, better olives to begin with, PITS, and careful processing.  The pits make a huge difference in any olive---they impart a nutty flavor to the flesh.  In the case of Grabers, the flaver is nutty and buttery. If you want to impress your guests at a buffet, serve Grabers---and go for the big size 16 olives.  They'll cost you about $2 each (i.e., per olive), but are worth it.  Unfortunately, Lindsay does not sell unpitted olives.<br /><br />I also recommend <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FAKUP0\">Byzantine Fresh Olive Antipasto, 5-Pound Bag</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FAIR46\">Byzantine Pitted Country Olive Mix, 5-Pound Bag</a> Both are nice mixes of unpitted olives, without hot-peppers or other excessive flavoring.\n",

I seriously surround myself with anything rosy!<br /><br />So when I saw this, *rose preserves*, literally preserves made with real rose petals, I couldn't wait to try it. Oh, the wait was incredible! When it finally arrived I didn't even wait for the toaster, I grabbed a spoon and dug right in!<br /><br />It's delicious. Divine. Extraordinary. It feels absolutely indulgent, eating a jam made of roses. It's so romantic and positively Victorian. There couldn't be a daintier dollop for your scones at tea time.<br /><br />So far I've had rose preserves on waffles, toast, ice cream, fresh fruit & yogurt, and coffee cake. I daresay it would even make a unique sweetener for hot tea.<br /><br />Speaking of sweet, that is my one issue. I find these preserves to be really much sweeter than I generally like; I prefer a bit more tartness, even in jams. Don't get me wrong: it's not overpoweringly sweet, there *is* a definite rose flavor in this, and definitely real petals adding unique flavor and texture. I just wish it weren't quite so sweet. But apparently, according to another reviewer who has tried other brands, Kafkas Rose Preserves are the *least* sugary! Any bit sweeter and it would definitely overpower the delicate rose flavor.<br /><br />So, while I can't give it a full 5 stars because I think it's too sweet -  and by the way I sure wish I could only deduct a half star -  I acknowledge that Kafkas Rose Preserves might be the best available. I certainly won't stop putting it on everything and yes, occasionally enjoying a tiny spoonful!<br /><br />I'm going to host a little tea party for my two little nieces and our American Girls dolls (My <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010XH10I\">American Girl Samantha Doll & Paperback Book</a>, Joelle's <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZHY3H4\">American Girl Julie Doll and Paperback Book</a>, and Lisey's <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BZYZAO\">American Girl Kit Kittredge Doll & Paperback Book</a>) and I know the girls will get a kick out of eating jam made of flower petals! I'm also looking forward to my extended family's next brunch, because I will be proudly serving up some rose preserves. In fact, I may be giving out Kafkas Rose Preserves as hostess gifts in lieu of the boring bottles of moscato or prosecco I'm forever dragging to parties. This would be promptly opened and enjoyed, I'm sure of it!<br /><br />If you're a rose lover, or looking for a unique gift, perhaps a cute and clever new spin on \"a bouquet of roses and a box of candy\", I highly recommend these rose preserves!\n",

      "I tried both this brand and the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0046IIPMW\">Purity Farm Organic Ghee, Clarified Butter, 13-Ounce</a> brand of ghee because as far as I can tell these are the two brands that are from completely grass fed cows, which I was elated to see because of the health and flavor benefits.<br /><br />I'll say that this one takes the slight edge in the taste and aroma department. It has a rich buttery smell, and it seems like they clarify it a little less because it's slightly grainy when you taste it at room temperature.<br /><br />That said, I find myself buying the Purity Farm ghee because this brand is almost twice as expensive and while it has the edge in taste, it is very very slight and not worth the big premium to me. It might be worth it if I was primarily using this at room temperature like on bread, but I usually use regular butter for that, and for cooking you really cannot tell any difference in flavor. There is also a chance I am getting ghee from different times of the year for each brand which does affect the flavor.<br /><br />So in short, amazing high quality ghee, but a bit overshadowed by the much cheaper and also amazing high quality <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0046IIPMW\">Purity Farm Organic Ghee, Clarified Butter, 13-Ounce</a> brand ghee.\n",

Perhaps wrapped it in small bubble wrap and taping it securely as I've seen done with other less fragile items I've ordered. I was especially annoyed however that there is NO way of returning it!

      "When Pet Promise, a safe and healthy pet food, went out of business, I was desperately looking for another healthy food that had no by-products, rendered fats, meat meals, or outsourced ingredients. (You might want to check out what these types of ingredients can include - if your stomach can take it - but avoid commercial manufacturers' \"spins\" on this). Good books to get in this regard are \"Foods Pets Die For\" and \"Protect Your Pet\":<br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0939165562\">Food Pets Die For: Shocking Facts About Pet Food</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0939165422\">Protect Your Pet: More Shocking Facts</a><br /><br />My cats were completely unaffected by the melamine contamination tragedy of 2007 - which killed many pets, especially cats - because their Pet Promise food was one of the few brands in America that didn't use outsourced ingredients (and was never on the recall list - unlike some of the very expensive \"premium brands\"). I felt so lucky that I had already switched to Pet Promise, a petfood company that bought ingredients only from North American farmers using sustainable agriculture and free-range livestock.<br /><br />I finally discovered Halo's products, and was encouraged by the fact that Ellen DeGeneres, a devout animal lover herself, not only endorses it but also has become part-owner of the company. Their website also included a specific message written to us former Pet Promise users. So I went to my health-food store and bought some.<br /><br />I was delighted to see that it had no by-products, no rendered meats, no meat meals, and that the label stated that all its ingredients are \"Made in the USA\", except the pea protein from Canada. Furthermore, the salmon in Halo is wild Alaskan, not farmed salmon (aka, pharmed salmon, full of antibiotics, etc.). Moreover, it is low in carbohydrates and even includes probiotics in the mix! Making it even more promising than Pet Promise!<br /><br />But the ultimate test was whether my cats would eat it or not. Unlike my dachshunds, who would eat just about anything that hit the floor (they're really low to the ground, you know), cats are notorious for their persnickety eating habits. BUT THEY LOVE IT!!! Can't get enough! So I have to dole it out so they don't overeat! And after five months, their health and energy seem to be great.<br /><br />Oh, and hi, Ellen - and many thanks!\n",

They are a great snack and are somewhat filling.<br /><br />The dark chocolate covered nibs are also good. The small package contains a lot more nibs than it seems at first. The nibs are crunchy, high in antioxidants, and a little bit bitter, but the dark chocolate balances the bitterness nicely.<br /><br /> The chocolate covered bananas were also delicious.

So unless it wows me, without sweetener will always be lower in points so to compensate I add .5 points to the unsweetened taste average.<br /><br />-Sweetened<br />++Hot (2.5)- Adding the sweetener (1 pkg of truvia) bring out the flavors a bit more, again I'm not a fan of the flavors so that is apparent in this review but the sweetener definitely improves the flavor.<br />++Iced (3.5) -  Better over ice! The flavor is definitely brought out more by the sweetener, would certainly take this over a sugar laden ocean spray cranberry cocktail or something of that nature. I could even see using this as a mixer in some adult beverages the taste is there for it.<br /><br />-2nd Steep (2.5) - When the tea was steeping the second time I was concerned I was in for further disappointment, the color is certainly lighter but the flavor is about the same level.  I always rate this to see how economical a tea is.<br /><br />Summary - My typical everyday go-to iced tea is a blend of hibiscus (for the BP lowering qualities and taste), and other flavors, and I am on a rooibos kick as of late. However as previously stated, I do not typically like the flavors of cranberry and/or pomegranate therefore I would not ordinarily be attracted to this flavor to begin with and am only drinking it because it was included with my order. I will certainly finish the box, but I would not buy it again. If you enjoy the flavor of pomegranate and or cranberry you will most likely enjoy it, and I would certainly not discourage you from it.<br /><br />I have many other tea reviews so keep checking back.

      "As a self proclaimed pizza expert, originating from St. Louis, then residing in Chicago, and sampling pizza around the nation, at some of the most prized pizza joints in the country, as well as international attempts...I began making my own pizza's again..this time using Pastorelli's own pizza crusts (thin, crispy style) and the different varieties of Pastorelli's sauces.  The full flavor and balance of spices in this stuff is fabulous enough to literally 'eat if from the can'.  Seriously.  What amazed me is that I have asked dozens of pizza shop owners, and new restaurant 'attempts' at pizza recipes, what sauce they use....many going with food service items from wholesalers (Pastorelli DOES sell food service quantities).  Bland is the word with many sauces, and some too strong in their spices.  This family owned business has this science and art nailed down, and the quality of all of Pastorelli products is premium, without a high price tag.  If you want to really enjoy the best home made pizza, then Pastorelli's pizza sauces are the ONLY way to go.  Buy a can, jar (squeeze), and grab some of their new crusts, and then make up your own recipes and see for yourself.  The sauce 'carries' the pizza.  Their pasta sauces are amazing, yet not easy to find....hopefully their distribution will expand.  Personally, I love Amazon....so I'm set.  Thank you Rick Pastorelli for continuing the best in tomatoes.....<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SAXVW0\">Pastorelli Pizza Sauce Italian Chef, 15-Ounce (Pack of 12)</a>\n",

I thought they finally got that better with more packaging but the last box I received was sent in the original box the crackers come in and no other protective packaging. Almost all of the crackers are so broken that it's hard to figure out what piece goes with what.<br />This new batch of crackers also has a very different taste. Much more salty and less sesame seed taste. When I contacted the company about the change in taste I was told: \"Nothing has changed other then we added vitamin E but that shouldn't change the flavor\". Well.... Something did and I let them know it's not the same and they never got back to me. I guess they don't care that their crackers have changed and customers will notice.

The overall taste is reminiscent of a light to medium roast <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5MS4\">Seattle's Best</a>.

I would still be pulling Swingline staples out of my backside if he didn't like it.<br /><br />Here's what another one said:<br /><br />\"...On the initial taste, when hottest, one can mistake this for a light roast as there is no bitterness in the aftertaste usually associated with Medium to Dark Roasts.  On subsequent sipping the coffee's taste does linger well afterword with little to no bitterness; again much like a light roast, but with fuller flavor that one expects from more robust roasts.  This coffee has enough flavor to warrant very little sweetener and no cream at all which should make most coffee enthusiasts happy with this selection...Recommended.\"<br /><br />This one works in tech support - I would be typing this review with one hand if he didn't enjoy this coffee.<br /><br />I even made sure to get an opinion from the usual tea drinker:<br /><br />\"Right-o.  So, as a tea-drinking-my-coffee-must-have-creamer-so-I-don't-taste-the-coffee person, here are my impressions:<br />Smell: slightly bitter with an earthy tone<br />Sight: Rather dark, not pitch black, but dark enough for concern.<br />Taste (black): Dirt with a side of mud.  Very straight forward coffee, no messing about.<br />Taste (with creamer...lots of creamer): my tongue thanked me!<br /><br />Not my favorite as a drinking coffee, I prefer a lighter roast.  But, it would be a good baking coffee, particularly if you used it for a dark mocha torte or for mocha cookies.\"<br /><br />So there you have it!<br /><br /> I should also add that I usually don't make the coffee in my office - ever since I served this, I have been asked \"Where's that coffee you brought in last week?

The biscuits are about 0.5\" thick and 1\" x 2.5\" in size with a score line so you can break it cleanly in half.<br /><br />I'm pleased that there are only 6 ingredients in the mix but palm oil is being used which, organic or not, takes away some of the health appeal.  Regardless, I would consider these treats to be healthier than most.<br /><br />Would I buy a 6-pack of 10-oz bags? I find the price point somewhat high for biscuit treats so I would consider it if Lucy really showed interest in them but at this time these treats are not high on my shopping list.\n",

      "This review is based on my impression of the Newman's dog treats, and the reaction of my two dogs. The variables:<br /><br />1) I have two Lhasapoos (mixed breed), almost 13 yrs old, with healthy teeth.<br />2) One is 13 lbs & one is 11 lbs, comparable in size to a large (not fat) house cat.<br />3) They are fed dry dog food, which is left in a feeder, so they eat whenever they like -- even so, they only eat small amounts.<br />4) When they are given a \"treat,\" it's not all the time, and they receive either a dog biscuit or a raw-hide stick -- never people food.<br /><br />When I opened the bag, the Newman treats didn't smell any differently than their usual dog biscuits, and I was concerned with the large size. I noticed they had an indentation in the middle, but only a few biscuits were easy to break in half; most of them were just too hard to snap -- and I have strong hands...I can't imagine someone with arthritis being able to break one of these in half. The Newman treats are a great size for a bigger breed, like a golden retriever, for instance.<br /><br />I put the Newman biscuits in the same canister that I use for other treats, even though the bag is resealable. I wasn't sure if the bag would affect my dogs' reactions to a new treat. By the way, I did read all the ingredients on the bag & it all looked healthy to me. I didn't see a reason why the dogs wouldn't like the treats.<br /><br />I gave them half a piece each, after their morning potty break; they do not eat at night because they sleep in our bedroom with the door closed. They appeared very excited until the pieces were in their mouths, and then both dogs spit the pieces out & stared at me like I just tried to feed them dirt. I told them, \"you're not getting anything else for a treat,\" and walked away; they reluctantly ate the pieces. Over the past week or so, I've given them a whole biscuit every other day. They always eat them, but they don't wolf them down (no pun intended, really) they way they do with their <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EBIP5W\">Milk-Bone Biscuits for Small Dogs</a>.<br /><br />Perhaps it is a texture issue? Too bad my dogs can't tell me...not to give TMI, but I am the one who does \"poop patrol\" in the backyard & the biscuits don't seem to have affected the consistency or size of the poop. (Look, I don't normally review dog food -- I'm not sure what other dog owners would be concerned about LOL)<br /><br />Anyway, I don't recommend this product for dogs under 25 lbs, or dogs with weak teeth or dental problems that could affect crunching-ability.\n",

      "I thought the NEWMAN'S OWN ORGANIC LAMB AND BARLEY DOG TREATS were like the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AEHN5A\">Newman's Own Organics Chicken and Rice Training Treats</a>, which are in stick form and easy to break, but these are thick and hard biscuits!<br /><br />My Shiba Inu is only 6-months old and weighs about 13-15 lbs. so she had a hard time chewing on the treat. I had to soak it in water a little bit and that allowed her to break off corners of the treat with her mouth and eat them that way. She seems to enjoy them, though, and they smell really good that I'm tempted to try one.<br /><br />The LAMB AND BARLEY BISCUIT TREATS are pretty big but they're scored so you can break them in half easily and they come in a resealable bag. Another issue is that the treats leave crumbs, but that may be my Shiba's fault, so it's best giving these treats on a hard surface rather than carpet.<br /><br />I posted some pics of the treats so you can get a sense of the scale.<br /><br />Otherwise, these snacks are made with only essential ingredients and skips the wheat and corn products, as well as the meat-by-products, and should provide a healthier alternative to other commercially made dog biscuits that have a bunch of fillers and chemicals in them.\n",

      "Okay, I love many Newman's Own products (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTJ6IA\">Newman'S Own Marinara Pasta Sauce With Mushrooms ( 12x24 OZ)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTP1VG\">Newman's Own Ranch, 16-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a>) so why not try giving some to my favorite furry friend?  The promises on the package look good - made with organic barley, no wheat, no corn - and the analysis on the back tells me that my West Highland White Terrier will receive 9% minimum of crude protein, 4% minimum of crude fat, 4% maximum of crude fiber.  The ingredients are organic barley, organic lamb, organic carrots, organic applies, organic palm oil (preserved with mixed tocopherols, a source of vitamin E), and organic molasses.<br /><br />So it sounds good, but how will it be received.  I cannot say that my Westie is a particularly fussy eater (I have yet to meet a terrier who is), but there have been times that he has opted to walk away rather than take a second treat, so I can only assume that after his first bite he was less than interested.  Like any good dog, he can running at the sound of the package rustling, with high hopes that this might be for him.  I pulled out a treat approximately the size of the mousepad on my laptop (or you can look at your keyboard - as wide as your Shift key and as tall as Enter and Shift together).  While my little guy thinks he's a big dog, I know better, so this had to be broken down.  Fortunately, there is a nice perforation down the middle making it easy to break apart for him.  That half would still be a pretty big treat for a smaller dog, but it works nicely for my little guy.<br /><br />I gave him one piece and he took it and waited, hoping I would go ahead and hand him the other so he could take them both away.  After I told him one was all he was going to get, he took his piece out in the yard (he likes to go on the deck to eat his treats).  In just a couple of minutes, he was back and waiting patiently for another.  As soon as I produced the other half, he was up on his back legs and watching that treat intently.  Even now he is watching me since he heard the crinkling as I was getting the information off the bag.  I think my Westie is Newman's Own's newest fan!<br /><br />These are a little pricier than the treats I typically purchase for him, but if you only use these for special treats it should not be too much.  Besides, it makes sense to me to care just as much about what I put into his body as I can about what I put into mine.\n",

      "My dogs love these treats.  There are a number of other lower-quality brand treats in our \"treat cabinet\", but both of my dogs start trying to get to the Newman's Own bag whenever I open the cabinet door.  I can definitely tell they like them the most.  And shhhh, don't tell them... but it is probably the healthiest choice for them from all the treats in that cabinet.<br /><br />The treats sort of smell nice... dare I say \"fresh\".  I am almost tempted to break off a small piece and try it myself (ALMOST, but not quite).<br /><br />I think I will stop buying the cheaper, unhealthier brand treats from now on and go with the Newman's Own Organics line.  It will be a nice compliment to their quality dog food, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009X0RA6\">Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul</a>.\n",

      "I have to LOL a bit at the \"How do you rate this item?\" question for this review.  How would \"I\" rate the item?  Do \"I\" like it?  Uh, sure, I feel really emotional about this item and I absolutely love it, can't you just picture me sitting here chewing on one of these treat biscuits?<br /><br />I suppose I shouldn't joke too much here since there's been stories of some people eating dog food for years, but really, I'm the human in the animal+human equation here and my opinion really isn't the one that matters for this product.  What matters is what the doggie thinks, or how she seems to react to being given one of these treats.  It's here that things remain tough though as the family dog behaves like many dogs do -- if it's at all edible, and heck, for a lot of things that aren't (like her stuffed toys that all die quick deaths), she'll have it gone so quickly you question whether she ever even tasted whatever it was you gave her.<br /><br />With that said, these dry biscuits do tend to slow her down a little, at least compared to some of the other treats we might give her.  (For example: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OUOYH6\">Cardinal Laboratories Pet Botanics Training Rewards Treats, Beef 20 Ounces</a>).  Being dry, she's got to slow down a bit and crunch up these treats.  In our case, with a smaller dog (Pomeranian), she really has to crunch things up, even if we break these biscuits apart (they come as breakable bars with two smaller portions in each bar).  A larger dog wouldn't have that much work to do, or at least I doubt they would.  I'll find out a bit later as I intend to take a few of these treats over to my lady friend's house where her much bigger family dog can give them a try.<br /><br />Realistically, the Newman's Own brand is one that I enjoy supporting.  They have a good reputation for me and their products are always good.  These dog treats seem to be yet another good example of that.\n",

When it comes to coffee, I suppose that it's really a \"to each his or her own\" thing. But I've tried 'em all, and out of all the various varieties that are offered here at Amazon, the K-cup that provides the most pleasurable mix of everything that I was looking for in a cup of coffee is undisputedly Emeril's Big Easy Bold.<br /><br />Nothing beats Emeril's Big Easy Bold. There are plenty of other brands trying to suggest that they're bold. I've tried the \"Midnight Magic\" brand; I've tried the \"Jet Fuel\" brand; I've tried the \"Donut Shop\" brand; I've tried all of the \"Extra Bolds\"; but the K-cup that really tastes like the jet fuel packed cup of coffee that you get in the best donut shop is Emeril's Big Easy Bold.<br /><br />What's really cool is that whether you make a small cup or large cup of Emeril's Big Easy Bold, you won't lose the rich flavor. Most Keurig Coffee Makers have at least two buttons that let you choose to make a large or small cup. Some even have three buttons for a large, medium or small. I like a large cup. Some of the other brands noticeably lost some of their flavor as I went from a medium cup to a large...but not the Emeril's.<br /><br />There is no question here.

      "Well, where to begin.<br /><br />First, I have been drinking tea (green, black, oolong, white, etc.) for more than 15 years as either loose leaf (whole leaf) or bagged. My number one love is green tea ... specifically Japanese Sencha. I have consumed many grades and types of steaming (mild, medium and \"deep\"). I have also tried many of the products offered by \"Two Leaves and a Bud\" by way of Whole Foods (who do not offer this).<br /><br />This is the first offering by Two Leaves that I sadly have to say is dreadful. Before you think I'm a jerk, let me say that they offer some awesome bagged teas. This just isn't one of them (IMHO).<br /><br />The orange that they add KILLS all of the beauty that the Sencha could potentially offer. What's worse is they suggest a steeping time of 4-minutes. Ludicrous. Most mild steamed (which this is) or medium steamed Sencha's steep for no more than 3-minutes. Four minutes will produce an acrid bitter brew unless the Sencha is a superior grade (which this doesn't appear to be).<br /><br />Even after steeping this for about 3 minutes, the taste is still overwhelmingly sharp & \"bitty\" (just a weaker sharp). I can not believe that the people at Two Leaves have ever had a good cup of loose leaf Sencha. I can't. If they have, they wouldn't offer this.<br /><br />I can only assume they add so much orange to it because the Sencha grade is poor. Otherwise, why not sell it without the orange flavor like the wonderful <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FGZKWM\">Two Leaves and a Bud, Tamayokucha Extremely Green Tea, Tea Bags, 100 Count</a> they offer? The Tamayokucha is excellent! No orange flavor needed, and I bet none is needed here either.<br /><br />Bummer is that I was dumb enough to buy the 100 count box (my bad). There is no way I can drink the rest of it and I would feel horrible if I gave it away to someone. They would think I had no taste in teas.<br /><br />My advice: buy a single box of this first.

      "PAMELA'S OAT CHOCOLATE CHIP COCONUT WHENEVER BAR, with a glass of cold skim milk, was my after-dinner dessert this evening. While it served its purpose as a cap to the evening meal quite nicely, it left me somewhat bemused.<br /><br />Not to put too fine a point on it, coconut was the only flavor discernable by me in the gustatory experience. Though obviously made with oats and containing chocolate chips, a taste of neither of those two ingredients came through.<br /><br />The \"mouth feel\" of the bar is pleasant enough. It's of medium density - as compared to the heavy density of a Bobo's Oat Bar (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZGW714\">Bobo's Oat Bars All Natural, Banana, 3-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a>) - and moist. Though the oat fiber is recognizably present in the texture, it's the flaked coconut that's most perceivable. The chocolate chips, while visible, contribute nothing at all in my opinion. (Again, if you're seeking a taste of oats, go to the Bobo's Oat Bar, which is very strong in that regard. If you're seeking the taste of chipped chocolate, don't dither about; go to a chocolate chip cookie, gluten-free if desired.)<br /><br />Pamela is apparently promoting an alternative snack for the nutritionally conscious and/or challenged as the packaging all but screams \"Wheat-Free\", \"Gluten-Free\" and \"Non-Dairy\", though the last claim is asterisked and clarified in the ingredients list with \"chunks may contain traces of milk protein due to manufacturing equipment.\"<br /><br />The box also lists \"180 mg Omega 3 Fatty Acids\", \"9 Grams Whole Grains\" and \"0 Grams Trans Fats\", apparently for each 40 gram, 180 calorie, single-serving bar.<br /><br />To allow the buyers to feel altruistic when purchasing the product, it's also noted in the fine print that \"Pamela's Products donates to Celiac Sprue and Autism Support Organizations.\" Celiac sprue is caused, of course, by dietary gluten intolerance.<br /><br />While I'd otherwise award at least 4 stars to this bar, I'm only going as high as three because the product's taste potential seems so badly misrepresented by its name. Unless you especially like coconut, you may do better seeking gratification elsewhere. And if you dislike coconut, definitely steer clear.\n",

      "I love coconut macaroons and chocolate but I don't like to put on a lot of calories. These bars are a delightful snack, especially if you are trying to avoid gluten and/or dairy. The amount of sugar in a bar is low, probably in part due to the use of agave. I'm not really fond of agave and don't feel they really need it, since there is also some sugar in the chocolate chips. There is also a little too much salt for my taste but I still think this is a great quick snack for rare occasions.<br /><br /> I make my own cookies with apple sauce, using a variation of a recipe on the side of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EDDS6Q\">Bob's Red Mill Old Country Style Muesli, 40-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)</a> but I leave out the sugar and salt and I add some coconut. These are even better and chewer than Pamela's but then, of course, they DO take about 20 minutes to make.

      "When we received our Keurig Elite for Christmas, we were so excited to break open the sample pack of pods to try out different blends and flavors.  Of the 12 pods we had in the box, four were Green Mountain Coffee brand.  I'd never tried anything from this company before, but from what I had researched online, they have the largest range of Keurig pods and have even bought out competitors to produce coffee under their brand names as well.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I was immediately disappointed by the quality of the coffee.  We tried their Dark Magic, Decaf and Breakfast Blend and all were underwhelming, to say the least.  I was almost completely set on writing off Green Mountain altogther.<br /><br />We had one GM pod left and being of the mindset of waste-not-want-not, I figured I'd give it one last go around before forgetting about them completely.  And I'm glad I did.<br /><br />The Nantucket Blend is a perfectly pleasing cup of coffee.  It is nice and flavorful without being thick and pungent (unlike some of the other GM blends we tried).  I added some flavored creamer to it and it almost measures up to our go-to Caribou Blend pods.  Almost.  All in all, this is a very standard cup of coffee which, while it isn't anything new or exciting, is very pleasing and definitely one of the better Keurig options we've been able to test out.  When we run out of all the pods we've accumulated, I'll probably pick up a box of these as well.<br /><br />Now that I know Green Mountain isn't completely disappointing I'll definitely be open to trying a few more of their coffees (with our promotion for getting the bewer we ordered <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I3Y4IE\">Green Mountain Coffee Golden French Toast,  K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a> to try as well) and see how it goes from there.<br /><br />If you're looking for a go-to choice, this is your cup!\n",

I made a video interview of him eating the noodles for dinner, after he came home from judo practice (hungry).<br /><br />Our family enjoys Nong Shim instant noodles. We stock our pantry every autumn with bowls of ramen, yakisoba and udon. Nong Shim is the leading brand of ramyoen (ramen instant noodles) in South Korea.<br /><br />The package design is getting better. The endorsement by Professional Chefs (a 2011 Chef's Best Award) is easier to read and three colored boxes in the lower right corner note that the noodles have no MSG added, there's 30% less sodium than their regular product and that the noodles have 0 grams of trans fat.<br /><br />I recommend adding refrigerator scraps to your instant noodles; perhaps, whole kernel corn (for sweetness) or some tofu, finely chopped green onions (scallions), chopped, cooked beef, chicken or seafood. An egg is another delicious addition.<br /><br />Rating: Five stars.<br /><br />Earlier this year, J. Kenji Lopez-Alt, executive editor at Serious Eats, posted \"Ramen Hacks: 30+ Easy Ways to Upgrade Your Instant Noodles.\" I highly recommend you search out and read the full article because you will never go back to relying on the flavoring packet alone to make instant noodles.<br /><br />I distilled his tips down to these four bullet points:<br /><br />* Simple Add-ins -- Miso paste, chili bean sauce, Thai curry paste, Japanese curry powder, fish sauce, harrisa, vinegar and ponzu.<br /><br />* Vegetation -- Baby spinach, romaine lettuce, bean sprouts, thinly sliced cabbage, watercress, and scallions \"should wilt in a matter of seconds.\"<br /><br />* Eggs -- Hard boiled, soft boiled, the egg-drop method, poached eggs and fried eggs.<br /><br />* Simple Simmered Meat -- Thinly sliced meats cook in a matter of seconds directly in the pot. Chicken breast, pork tenderloin, or flank steak are all great candidates.<br /><br />Instant noodles available at Amazon that our family eats and recommends:<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003MOX6RA\">Nong Shim Big Bowl Noodle Udon</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003MP136A\">Nong Shim Big Bowl Noodle Kimchi</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00171FB7I\">Nong Shim Beef and Ginger Bowl</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LQNK5A\">Nong Shim Kimchi Noodle Bowl</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0028PDFQG\">Myojo Ippeichan Yakisoba Noodles</a><br /><br />In many cases you can sign up for Amazon's Subscribe & Save program for additional savings and convenience.\n",

      "I had my picky 15-year-old son to try this Nong Shim Spicy Chicken Noodle Bowl, and he liked it a lot: \"The flavor is good.  Has a major spiciness, which I like.  Little overpriced.  For the price, I'd probably just get ramen.  Can't really taste the chicken.  The picture on the package is misleading; the chicken chunks aren't that big.  Overall, quite good.\" But he complained that there are two lines inside the bowl, so he didn't know which to fill it to (he used the lower line).<br /><br />These are basically like the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0047TAKQ4\">Cup O Noodles</a> almost everyone has had at some point, but a little bigger and with a more complex taste.  Very handy and easy to prepare, but definitely overpriced for what you're getting.  And the nutrition numbers make it something you won't want to eat regularly.  This 3-oz bowl is unrealistically listed as two servings.  Who is going to split a noodle cup??  If you eat the whole thing, it has 380 calories, 14g fat, 1780mg sodium, 56g carbs, 2g fiber, and 8g protein.<br /><br />This wouldn't be a terrible option to keep in a desk drawer at work for unexpected days when you just can't get out, or possibly to take camping, or just for having a few around the house for emergencies, but it's definitely not something I would (or let my family) eat regularly.\n",

I add <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HNZRKQ\">TABASCO brand Chipotle Pepper Sauce - Gallon</a> to the tortilla pizza that I make with cheese and herring since this is heavier and tastier but not as spicy as the original red or green.

Its got 135 calories so is not a diet drink.  It's really sweet and would go well as a drink mixer like the watermelon strawberry variety.<br /><br />It's got light carbonation, 100% of the USRDA of vitamin C and costs about $1.00 a can.  Personally, I'll stick to plain old tap water because this is really just extra calories and not worth $1.00 a can.  It is a nice fruity sweet drink that many might like to go along with lunch.\n",

The drink is tasty, and I prefer the carbonation over a straight juice product. I feel the carbonation imparts a slightly bitter finish, but that it adds to the drinkability of what is essentially a sweet but unimposing fruit flavor. So while there is nothing particularly wrong with the drink, I can't really get enthusiastic about it and I think there are better, tastier, and more economical selections available.

      "In the Beginning there was Fruit Juice, and there was Soda Pop, and never the twain should meet... unless you mixed them yourself. But then somebody got the Great Idea -- when reconstituting fruit juice after Pasteurization, why not reconstitute it with carbonated water? Thus was born...<br /><br />Soda Juice!<br /><br />And I tasted it, and it was Good! Frankly, I found Black Cherry, Kiwi Berry, and Watermelon Strawberry pretty similar in taste, Orange Tangerine more distinctly tart, but I enjoyed all of them.<br /><br />In the cans you have 5 other flavor choices: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG940E\">The Switch Black Cherry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH2C\">The Switch Fruit Punch, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG943G\">The Switch Grape, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG945O\">The Switch Orange Tangerine, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH54\">The Switch Watermelon Strawberry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.<br /><br />Since virtually nothing is added, the slight nutritional differences must be due to the characteristics of the different juices being used. Fruit Punch, Orange Tangerine, and Watermelon Strawberry have the highest calories, 140; Kiwi Berry is next, 135; Black Cherry is next, 130; and Grape has the lowest, 125.  Orange Tangerine and Watermelon Strawberry have the highest total carbohydrates, 36g; Black Cherry and Fruit Punch are next, 35g; Kiwi Berry is next, 34g; and Grape has the lowest, 33g. Finally Watermelon Strawberry has the highest sugars, 35g; Fruit Punch and Orange Tangerine are next, 34g; Black Cherry and Kiwi Berry are next, 33g, and Grape is the lowest, 32g.<br /><br />Note: all of these are fruit juice blends so those with fruit juice health concerns need to be aware of more than just the title juice. All contain acerola, apple, and grape juice. In addition to their title juices Kiwi Berry contains raspberry and strawberry, and Fruit Punch contains cherry, lemon, and pineapple.  Orange Tangerine also contains soy.<br /><br />Compare and Contrast: a similar product is worth considering: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYY1E\">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Apple, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYXYW\">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Blackberry, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014X5O1C\">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Clementine, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYXTC\">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Grapefruit, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYXQK\">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Pomegranate, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.

They were refreshing and because they did not add any sugar we could fool ourselves into thinking they were healthy (they are healthier...)<br /><br />When we saw Switch, we thought we might be getting even more of the same in new flavors.  Unfortunately, these are more syrupy than the Izzy's.  At least for adults, the are less crisp and refreshing.  However, kids would of course prefer these as they are sweeter.<br /><br />We also tried Watermelon/Strawberry and we liked the Kiwi Berry better.

      "The first sip gave a pleasing kiwi flavor burst with a light tang of carbonation.  When testing the black cherry flavor, I had placed the can in the freezer for a short period, since I prefer drinks to be ice cold or hot; I didn't want lukewarm to get in the way of a positive response to the first sip.  As the drink warmed a bit, the sweetness overtook the carbonation, which is inevitable in a carbonated beverage, yet, due to the purity of the fruit base, the flavor remained true and welcome.<br /><br />This time, I just had the drink chilled perfectly for me, no ice crystals.  I like the kiwi even better than the cherry!  The kiwi has more tang.  See below (or on the product description on the buying page) for the juice blends used.  I've noticed that most juices currently have apple and grape included, likely because those are cheaper to produce.<br /><br />The way the drink was promoted wasn't a lie!  It worked for me:<br /><br />1. \"100 % of what you want.  0% of what you don't want.\"<br /><br />2. \"Make The Switch to a great tasting, all natural beverage that's the perfect balance between JUICE and CARBONATION.\"<br /><br />3. The logo has \"THE\" placed upside-down and reversed, atop \"Switch,\" with a swirl designed around the words, the swirl imitating the symbol for reversing something.<br /><br />4. The ingredients read: \"100% juice (filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates, apple, grape, kiwi, acerola* [I added the asterisk; see below] and raspberry and strawberry juice concentrated), natural flavors, ascorbic acid (vitamin C)\"<br /><br />5. 100% juice carbonated.<br /><br />6. The can is smaller than the norm for soda pops, which I also liked, because when I used to drink sodas regularly, I usually opened a can and left half of it to get too warm (and fizzed out), so the remainder went down the drain (after I returned it to the fridge for a few days hoping I might drink it).  I drank the whole can of Black Cherry!<br /><br />I decided I liked the near slush state of a short stint in the freezer... leaving it too long, though, might cause too much separation of the fruit concentrate from the fizz water... and, of course, makes it undrinkable from the can until it melts enough to flow through the hole in the top.<br /><br />In the past, when I had begun wanting something more natural than most soda beverages (with phosphates, etc., added), I had used frozen orange juice concentrate added to Club Soda or Ginger ale.  It didn't take long to feel that the process was too much trouble (and it was more expensive than the cost of the Switch product).  Also, I like the types of fruits Switch is using.<br /><br />At first I was confused at the acerola* ingredient, not knowing what it was.  Since my <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00154JDAI\">Kindle 2: Amazon's New Wireless Reading Device (Latest Generation)</a> was at hand, as always, I looked up acerola in the onboard dictionary.  The word wasn't in there, so I pushed the curser to the right, on the arrow for more types of searches, and used my standby, Google, and found several listings of acerola.<br /><br />Briefly, I found that it's thought to have originated from the Yucatan, and is known as Barbados cherry or wild crape myrtle, a tropical fruit-bearing shrub.  Reading into the variety of praiseworthy qualities of that cherry, I was impressed!  It has 32 times the amount of vitamin C as Orange juice, and many other healthful assets.  If you're interested in details, feel free to go Google.<br /><br />I'm beginning to think that many of the flavors available from Switch will include equally intriguing tropical fruits.  (I was glad to see that the Kiwi flavor also has acerola in it).<br /><br />Though the can is appealing and fine, this beverage is good enough to deserve a designer bottle to appeal to the gourmet crowd who want flavor without true health issues... don't get me started on the myriad of heavy promotions of pseudo health issues.  I have a book in progress to be published on KINDLE, which will debut with steam hissing out of Kindle's ears, at no extra charge!  (I'll add a comment to this review about why I had quit drinking soda pops, which will explain why I will be happily able to welcome Switch into my diet.)<br /><br />My thanks to THE SWITCH for providing a healthy, gourmet quality drink... WITHOUT, thank God, SOYBEANS added!!<br /><br />I'm hooked!<br /><br />Linda Shelnutt<br />Author of several Kindle books and Amazon Shorts\n",

Tasty.<br /><br />I took one star off because ... well, no soda deserves 5 stars ... but mainly because there are a lot of calories for such a small tin, and the no sugar added label is deceptive since we all know that fruits have lots of naturally-occurring sugar and this is made from 100% fruit juice.<br /><br />Just on the taste alone though - definitely 4 stars.\n",

      "These 8.3 oz cans of Switch keep their promise. There are no added sugar, no corn syrup, and no preservatives. It is a carbonated all natural 100% juice. Like most of these `juices drinks' the ingredients state 100% Juice in this order; Filtered Sparkling Water Sufficient to Reconstitute Juice Concentrates, (Apple, Grape, Kiwi, Acerola, Raspberry and Strawberry Juice Concentrates), Natural Flavors, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C). I was very happy and surprised to even see Kiwi and Strawberry listed. Even though the Strawberry is listed last. Each can has 135 calories, 15mg of sodium, 34g of carbohydrates, 33g of sugar and 100% of RDA of Vitamin C.<br /><br />This sparkling juice did not have an identifiable taste of kiwi or strawberry. You could tell this was a mix of berries that blended the sweet with the tart for a refreshing drink. So it lives up to its name for it is called Kiwi Berry, not Kiwi Strawberry. So I was satisfied with its flavor. I liked the drink and would have more. But for my money I would rather by the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014X5O1C\">IZZE Fortified Sparkling Juice, Clementine, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> brand of fortified sparkling juice that has a cleaner taste and fewer calories.\n",

      "Right off the bat, know that Switch isn't your traditional soda. There's no added sugar, no corn syrup, and no preservatives. It's carbonated but is all natural and is 100% juice. So while it's just juice (with Vitamin C, by the way), it still has that poppy bite to it because of the carbonation.<br /><br />I had this with chips and it wasn't a great combination, so I had the drink by itself and it was much, much better. The kiwi berry flavor is pretty sweet (as kiwis and strawberries are), so I would probably recommend drinking this with a pastry or something like that. A fruity danish would be perfect. Pairing sweet to sweet is key.<br /><br />I'm really pleased with this flavor, so I will surely look into the other flavors available, most likely the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH54\">watermelon strawberry</a> since I'll probably get a similar taste.

      "I was terribly excited when I heard that Nescaf&eacute; had finally decided to just touch on the idea of carrying a wide array of flavors and intensities for straight espresso (I've always been so jealous of Nespresso's collection of capsules) by introducing a new single-shot Intenso. As I've been stuck making double-shots of their fairly disappointing <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H0FHZA\">Espresso</a> option for ages, I've decided to do a little comparison in reviewing this new and exciting addition.<br /><br />This is what we're working with: the Espresso has 6g of coffee in each capsule, while the Dark Roast Caff&eacute; Grande has 10g. As I noted in my <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H0FI0O\">Latte Macchiato</a> review: a generally accepted typical single shot of espresso is made up of 8g of ground coffee with the final shot sitting at no more than 35mL. The Espresso's instructions recommend ending up with 60mL of liquid, which seems to be a light amount of coffee for so much water (the Dark Roast doesn't do much better, recommending 200mL for 10g). For my taste-tests, I was able to pump out a fairly heavy 50mL single-shot espresso, while I kept the Dark Roast to about 150-160mL<br />(NOTE: the tips I give in the previously mentioned Macchiato review for really squeezing every mg of coffee out of these capsules I have a feeling only work with the Dolce Gusto machines that allow you to completely control the flow; while my machine has that ball-point silver lever pointing up out of the head of the dispenser (like the Melody 2 and Circolo), it seems the machines Nescaf&eacute; just released this past month (specifically the Creativa) are somewhat automated).<br /><br />Right off the bat, as I dispense the Grande I notice the thicker, creamier color and texture of the coffee, which it retains for a good 30 seconds until it settles into a deep brown with even less noticeable light passing through (compared to the Espresso). Even though my pour started pushing 160 mL, the thickness is far greater than the Espresso, with absolutely no hint of water. Literally, the liquid itself feels heavier and richer in your mouth. The Espresso just pales in comparison in regard to taste, aroma, and texture. I'm definitely not an expert when it comes to pinpointing descriptive flavors in espressos, but I'd say the espresso here has something between a sweet and bitter dominating taste. On the other hand, the Grande lacks any resemblance to the Espresso, and if anything I'd say there's a warm, spicy flavor that mixes quite well with the overall dark roast qualities.<br />Ofcourse, to those who know anything (and definitely more than me) about coffee, you might just say, 'Well, you're comparing a dark roast to a regular espresso'. Yes, I guess I am, and thus I should expect these differences. However, for the past three years now Nescaf&eacute; has only had one option when it came to a strong single-shot, the Espresso (the other choices were Caff&eacute; Lungo and then the Americano, both of which got further and further from deep and strong drinks). So, I guess giving this new Caf&eacute; Grande Intenso a try has ultimately given me a worthwhile competing option for the espresso-based choices. And I can finally enjoy a drink from my machine that only requires one capsule (the espressos could only do the trick in double-shots). For those of you who've been in a similar situation, this review should give you an idea of what to expect (and what you're missing out on!) with this new choice.<br /><br />As usual, buying the boxes from Amazon.com with the Subscribe and Save is the most inexpensive option I've found.<br />Also, make sure to sign-up online at Dolce Gusto's website for the award points you get with every box. With a box of three from Amazon (through Subscribe and Save), AND factoring in the 5 (sometimes 10) award points you get with every box (with which you may eventually redeem Amazon gift cards), the price per box drops to a little over 6 dollars (compared to ~9 dollars a box at Sur la Table and other retailers).<br /><br />Nescaf&eacute; has finally entered the realm of differing strengths and flavors for its espresso line, and those who felt the brand's mild espressos just weren't quite hitting the spot, this is a must-have and will easily be my go-to single-shot drink from now on!\n",

Because of this blend's mildness, I always add an extra tablespoon or two to the pot, to make the flavor a little richer. It's not necessary, but I think it improves the taste.<br /><br />Incidentally, darker roasts do not have more caffeine, even if psychologically they seem to have a bigger \"kick.\" This blend may be easy to drink, but it's got plenty of punch in the caffeine department -- my definition of a \"good morning\"!\n",

      "My 10 lbs chihuahua/doxie mix is a picky eater.  He isn't motivated by food at all, and it's always a trial and error when it comes to trying out a new treat.  His treats of choice are freeze-dried tripe, freeze-dried liver, freeze-dried chicken - you get the idea.  The boy has expensive taste - lol.<br /><br />That said, since he's now nearing the 9 year old mark, I wanted to begin giving him Glucosamine and Chondroitin for his hips and joints.  I started to notice that he has become a little reluctant to jump up on the bed, preferring to be helped up.  I think this is happening due to getting older. My usage of these treats is to help with prevention - better to start early before it's too late, you know?<br /><br />Feeding him pills is a hassle, and I'm already giving him globs of peanut butter a day to hide his <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015GS0BY\">Nutri-Vet Healthy Vision Canine Chewables</a> (I highly recommend these pills if you have a dog with vision issues).  Anyway, my quest for a non-pill form of Glucosamine and Chondroitin led me to Zuke's Hip Action.<br /><br />I love that it's wheat, corn and soy free.  My boy has skin allergies and I've been doing my best to keep his diet as clean as possible.  Each treat has 300 mg of Glucosamine and 50 mg of Chondroitin.  The treats also have antioxidants thanks to cherry, blueberry, rosemary, turmeric and seasame seed.  BTW - turmeric is a great Indian spice that also helps humans because of its anti-inflammatory benefits.  It also has egg shell membrane meal, which according to the package helps support joint health.  So, it has good stuff in it.  It's also made in the USA.  After all the issues with Chinese-made dog treats, avoiding treats from China is important to me and the health of my dog.<br /><br />For a small 46 lbs and under dog (like my Ozzy), only one treat is necessary per day.  For a medium dog of 98 lbs and under, 2 treats a day is necessary.  For a giant dog of 138 lbs and under, 3 treats are needed per day.  Each package has about 23 treats in it.  If you have a larger size dog, it definitely can get pricey.<br /><br />I feed Ozzy the peanut butter flavor, because, well, peanut butter is one of his favorite things in the world.  Each treat is square and has a moist look to it.  It has an interesting smell - not one of my favorites, but not completely a turn-off either.  Just...interesting.  But the best part is he LOVES them.  His eyes actually bug out more than the usual chihuahua buggy-eyed look, and he happily grabs it and runs off to enjoy it.  He looks forward to it every day.<br /><br />Ozzy recently had surgery on his ear, and during the time after his surgery, he was pickier than ever with food.  He refused to eat even the raw beef patties that he usually loves.  He barely even took the peanut butter hiding his eye vitamins, probiotics and antibiotics (and this is a dog that loves peanut butter)  But these Zuke treats?  Heck yeah! Never a problem.  Just goes to show how much he loves these treats.\n",

      "I started drinking one 12 ounce can of Celsius 15 minutes prior to weight and cardio workouts, and have found Celsius brand to be far superior to Monster in the energy boost it gives me.  Each 12 ounce can has 200mg of caffeine (check out the Celsius website...) so I don't drink any coffee on the mornings I'm off to the gym as when I do drink both, I tend to get jittery instead of 'boosted'.<br /><br />Celsius' fat burning claims come from the thermogenesis angle.  Meaning it will keep your metabolism fired up for a longer period of time (up to 3 hours post-workout) and thus you can potentially burn up to 100 extra calories.  It has ginger, chromium and green tea - all favored for their 'fat burning' properties, along with high vitamin C and B vitamins.  No sugar, no carbs, no preservatives, no high fructose corn syrup, no trans fats and very low sodium (6mg) make this a good energy drink choice in my book.  THIS flavor however, makes me want to gag!<br /><br />Orange flavor is a 'sparkling' version of Celsius.  Slightly carbonated, it could taste like a soda - Fresca would be the closest thing to it in my mind - but for me it simply tastes bitter and tough to swallow.  I do generally like orange flavored drinks, so this surprised me. I also found I had an upset stomach after drinking it.<br /><br />I do like two of the non-sparkling Celsius drinks and would recommend you try a few flavors before buying a case of them.  My favorite so far is <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002RSVOLM\">Celsius®, Raspberry Acai, 12 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> and if I can't find that one, I'll drink <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002RSRUPG\">Celsius®, Peach Mango, 12 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.  Neither tastes bitter to me, nor overly sweet.  There is no aftertaste and my stomach tolerated them well.<br /><br />One thing to note when using this supplement, it does seem to act as a diuretic.  I have to urinate a lot for several hours after drinking just one.  They say on the website that you can drink up to 3 a day (that's 600mg of caffeine a day...) and do not recommend this drink to anyone who is 12 or under, or caffeine intolerant.<br /><br />Check out their website for studies relating to fat loss and this product.\n",

      "Celsius Calorie Burner Orange is every bit (or more so) as energizing as any of the other energy drinks (Monster, AMP, etc), and it has a fairly good orange flavor. We tried this after trying the very good <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00153B3KW\">Celsius Calorie Burner, Cola, 12-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, and it comes in close second in taste.<br /><br />While I can't really confirm that this actually burns 100 Calories just by drinking a whole can, it certainly would not surprise me since this does pack a serious kick. I drink a can of Celsius about a half hour before my workouts and it does seem to give me more energy throughout the whole hour and half or so. On occasions where I don't have time to grab a cup of my morning coffee, one of these does the job of waking me up just fine.<br /><br />A note of caution: I do have a high caffeine tolerance (cultivated through years of drinking \"too much\" coffee) so while this is fine for me, my son tried one before his workout and got \"jittery\". Also, while not an issue about the drink, the can is made of very thin aluminum and is prone to ripping if you crush it, causing sharp edges that can (and did) cut fingers.<br /><br />Overall, this is an effective energy drink but it isn't as good tasting as the Cola flavor (which I even put it on automatic reorder) but is much better than the Green Tea Raspberry version (which other people seem to like).<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH\n",

With the exception of some specialty oils, such as walnut oil and truffle oil, this is the only oil I keep in the house anymore.<br /><br />A note on packaging:  When I purchased this through Amazon, both of the cans were dented.  Since I drain the oil into a tinted glass oil drizzler, that didn't bother me but FYI to those who might be.

Now, with Buffalo Wing Soda in hand, I was about to imbibe yet another dubious offering from ol' Lester.

Finally, I took my first swig...  In reality, it tasted sort of like a citrus soda that had been spiked with a couple teaspoons of hot sauce.  The spiciness gave a slight burning sensation to my esophagus, and a funky aftertaste lingered for a while after I had finished the beverage. Subsequently, \"rot gut\" began to settle in, and any lingering \"open mindedness\" that I still had toward this soda faded away exponentially...<br />As I type this review, the empty bottle sits next to me; I've now become acutely and unequivocally aware of the noxious smell continually wafting from the opening:  An unsettling hybrid scent of hot sauce and sickly sweetness.<br /><br />I like the novelity of this soda, but I don't think that I'll be drinking it again.\n",

Since I only drank tea at restaurants and my Mom's at obligatory dinners, no big deal.  Well as I slipped towards 50 I began to drink more coffee (which I liked) but which eventually led to a parting of ways due to the fact that the coffees I liked, did not return the favor and feeling slightly nauseous was not the desired effect I was looking to achieve.  One day a friend of mine suggested I try some quality tea (which meant nothing made by Tetley/Liptons/etc).  I tried <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000DBN2F\">Tazo Passion Tea, 24 Tea Bags</a> and while good it was missing that elusive element combination of good taste and adequate energy boost.  So I stumbled into this item <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4H5FY\">Twinings Variety Pack of Four Flavors, Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> which gave me 4 choices (great idea).  So without any additional ramblings are my opinions:  English Breakfast Tea = 5 Star, this stuff is great  /  Irish Breakfast Tea = Again 5 Stars, maybe a infinitesimal edge over the English version / Earl Grey = 4 Stars, good taste and flavor, not as good as the breakfast teas (IMHO) but probably better for later in the evening  / Lady Grey = WTF??  This stuff was horrible, I tried to use 1 bag of it with 2 bags of the others to keep from pitching it into the trash but to no avail, I am gonna give it to someone who has no taste buds.  1 Star.<br /><br />Again, realize I am far from a connoisseur of fine tea but I know what I like and what I don't, I am going to buy a few boxes of the breakfast teas and enjoy them.  BTW I also bought a huge box of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XEV9YE\">Taylors of Harrogate, Yorkshire Gold Tea, 160-Count Tea Bags</a> and to prove my tastes are obviously out of the norm I hated it (I wanted to love it but alas it has something added to it that sure ain't tea)\n",

      "Twinings Variety Pack of Four Flavors, Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6) at $17.14 is a STEAL.<br /><br />If you are not familiar with Twinings tea, then perhaps you ought to start tasting REAL tea - the type the Royal Family awakens to, the type everyone who enjoys tea outside the U.S. enjoys at tea time.<br /><br />Twinings, around since the beginning of the 18th century, literally saved my life. While I shall not go into that story, I will tell you what you can expect: a decent, dazzling cup of tea that will, I guarantee, make you basically drop coffee forever.<br /><br />I have enjoyed the meal known as 'tea' since I was a boy. My parents avoided it for some reason but I always had my Twinings. Since it got too complex hereabouts, I just order tea bags these days instead of a good old-fashioned brew-up with my favorite antique English teapot.<br /><br />It appears that in this variety pack you are getting the following: English Breakfast, Irish Breakfast, Earl Grey and Lady Grey. For you ignorant slobs, Irish breakfast is the finest, blackest and strongest tea you can get. English is a bit dialed back but it is just as hearty. These beg for cream and sugar, but it is no sin to have it black. The Greys are meant to be taken with lemon and you'll suffer if you try to pour cream or milk into either of them!<br /><br />So there you are: a world of tea in one neat box, from my ONLY tea providers and lifelong at that. You can visit their site and buy direct; you can examine <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006RXQ2CY\">The Queen</a> closely and watch for the scene that reveals the Queen Mum's preferred tea.<br /><br />My second favorite, Irish breakfast tea being my first love, is the incomparable <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MOWL8M\">Twinings English Afternoon Tea, Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (20 Tea Bags)</a>, blended from premium Keemun and Ceylon (just you try to get good Keemun at a reasonable price).<br /><br />In the event it interests you, Twinings tea bags are designed like Lipton's clever invention, the 'double' tea bag (what they originally named \"FLOW-THROUGH\") that you can puff apart a bit if you like before steeping it. Twinings does not have any staples anywhere on their teabags, unlike other companies with a staple here and a staple there. You might as well buy staple-flavored tea.<br /><br />Get Twinings good cheer, the genuine cup that cheers.\n",

      "This is the best Gunpowder tea you will buy for the $$. It's perfect for everyday green tea drinking. The tins are individually foil sealed so you can take your time getting through the lot, or share with friends and family. I usually take a tin to work and keep one at home. Some specialty grocery stores in Dallas carry the loose teas, but out in the suburbs, Amazon makes it easy and convenient. I priced this out one time and it's $$/oz is incredible bargain, the same tin at specialty grocers (Whole Foods, Central Market, World Market) is like $6-$8. Unless you have an Asian market with a bulk tea section close to you, probably not going to get more affordable.<br /><br />---Preperation<br />Use filtered water if you can, I get it from my Fridge since it has filter on the water in the door.<br /><br />~165-170 degress F (I stick a probe digital thermometer into the whistle hole on my stove-top kettle and set the alarm to go off at 165F, gives me time to get from the living room back to the kitchen without it getting too hot. I have the tea portioned and waiting for the water in my teapot, 6 tsp)<br /><br />~3-3:30 minutes steep time (covered)<br /><br />Do not boil or steep longer than 3:30 or it will become overpowering and bitter. If you like it stronger, add more tea.<br /><br />I alternate with the Twining's Prince of Wales loose (~195-200F, 4min steep time), it has become my favorite black tea.<br /><br />No cream or suger needed if you brew it correctly. The green tea can be reused for another brew, I typically add a tsp or two to the already brewed leaves and good to go.<br /><br />The <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I68NCS\">Finum Brewing Medium Basket, Black</a> is a perfect partner for your mug/pot at work. I just use the hot water tap on our coffee machine over the leaves in the basket, 3 minutes later you have perfect green tea at work with easy clean-up.<br /><br />Enjoy this tea!\n",

      "Where I'm located, my choices for loose green tea are practically non-existent.  I had found and tried this Twinings Gunpowder Green (loose) tea at a local Fresh Market.  I enjoyed it, but getting to that store (and their having it in stock) was troublesome.  I was very happy to see the same tea on Amazon for a bit over a dollar LESS (per tin) than my local cost (not including my travel time or tolls paid).  The tea has a very nice flavor (FAR better than the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5QPU\">Stash Premium Green Tea, Loose Leaf, 3.5-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 3)</a> which was the other green tea I'd found locally).  It also has a good color and aroma.  One of the things I like about gunpowder tea is that it's easy to portion out.  I scoop out 1 level teaspoon of tea and use it for two full serving in my <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010NR7C0\">Bodum YoYo Personal Tea Set with Infuser and 12-Ounce Glass</a>.  The tea leaves are of sufficient quality that there are almost no fragments, so nothing gets through the infuser but the flavor.  If I were a tea purist, I'd probably have some issue with the fact that the gunpowder rolls of leaves are not as tight as they should be and the spent leaves look like they're somewhat irregular.  But, considering that this tea is many times less expensive than the high quality stuff from the specialty shops, I'm very happy with it.  The one thing I'm just a touch worried about is storage.  The six tins in this package will last me many months.  Since each tin is opaque and is sealed with an aluminum film, I figured the best location for storing the tea until I moved it to my \"in-use\" spot would be the refrigerator.  The tin and the film should keep light and moisture out and the temperature fluctuations should be minimal.  But, I still worry a bit.  Still, I'm very pleased with the tea and rate it at a Very Good 4 stars out of 5.\n",

That being the bonus of this tea, you can add half of what you'd normally add to Earl grey [cream, lemon, honey] and save yourself a few calories.<br /><br />This is not a watered down version of Earl Grey, just a delicate tea.\n",

      "I never, ever drink 'diet' sodas and try to avoid most soda in general.  However, I do really enjoy <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003SBW50G\">Blue Sky Organic New Century Cola</a> and was curious to try a sugar-free version.  Ultimately, I decided to go with the root beer 'free' soda over a cola because I figured the stronger taste would better cover any strange stevia taste or aftertaste.  I don't buy or consume stevia in other products so I'm not really sure how it tastes on its own, but it's really not bad in this soda.  It also doesn't dry out your mouth like other sweeteners.  This soda definitely has a unique taste but, as another reviewer pointed out, I think you are mostly tasting the \"french sweet birch oil\" per the ingredient list.  It also lists tahitian vanilla, hence the 'creamy' aspect.  The ingredients are quality and while it still has zero nutritional value, it's a better bet over regular or other diet sodas by a long shot.<br /><br />One thing I do not like is the misleading description: yes the soda does contain stevia as a sweetener but it is the second to last ingredient on the list.  The second ingredient out of seven is erythritol, which is a sugar alcohol, and NOT how this product is advertised to be sweetened.  Via wikipedia, it is \"60-70% as sweet as table sugar yet it is almost non-caloric, does not affect blood sugar, does not cause tooth decay, and is absorbed by the body, therefore unlikely to cause gastric side effects unlike other sugar alcohols.\"  However, I bought this product because I wanted a natural (Stevia leaf) sweetened product rather than another lab-generated chemical.  Disappointed.  I'll probably continue to drink them over time, but will not be reordering.  The stevia content is minimal at best, with the main ingredients being filtered water and erythritol.  I'd rather consume 100 more calories and drink the natural and organic regular Blue Sky cola or root beer.<br /><br />You ARE still consuming an artificially-sweetened-with-chemicals drink!  If you're okay with that, the taste is nice.  But if, like me, that is exactly what you are trying to avoid, this product is not it.\n",

      "First and foremost I am not a tea drinker. I've tried for years to like tea and every tea I've ever tasted was bitter or had some nasty after taste (some were just nasty from the get go). So when I had the opportunity to taste this tea I said why not, maybe this will be different, and sure enough it was.<br /><br />When you first open the container you are hit with this blast of fragrances, ranging from flower like scents, to sweet citrus, something I have NEVER had with tea. I guess I've been drinking (at least trying to drink) the wrong teas...<br /><br />I took a couple of pinches of the tea (about two teaspoons worth) and put it in my <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CFPXYA\">Norpro Mesh Tea Ball with Cup Rest Handle</a>. After steeping the tea for a minute or so, I took my first taste and OH MY! It tasted nothing like any tea I have EVER had. No bitterness, after taste, or anything, just a very flavorful cup of tea. The citrus/orange flavor from the bergamot oil is extremely flavorful and aromatic, and again NOT the least bit bitter or harsh.<br /><br />If this is how tea is suppose to taste, I've been missing out for years and years and I am glad to say that I am not hooked on loose leaf teas. Move over coffee, I now have a new favorite warm beverage!<br /><br />Pros:<br />Extremely flavorful.<br />No bitter/harsh taste.<br />Organic (if that is something that will encourage you to buy it).<br />A fair trade product (again if that is something that will encourage you to buy it).<br /><br />Cons:<br />Price, though compared to other loose leaf teas it's a pretty good price...\n",

We both loved the tea. We were drinkning the Taylors of Harrogate Earl Grey tea, which we liked, but it wasn't organic.  This Rishi Earl Grey is similar in that it's not too perfumy of an Earl Grey. It really has a great flavor.  We both drink it with just milk.  I think that tea depends a lot on the water you use too.  We have well water and it's filtered.  Also the tin that the tea comes is has two lids, which keeps the tea fresher, longer.  Yum can't wait 'til morning.\n",

      "I've been doing a bit of experimentation with making pho at home, with varying degrees of success.  While the broth preparation is by far the most important, you simply can't toss in any kind of rice noodle and hope it will turn out ok.  Admittedly, I was a little worried about these noodles when ordering; the branding on the outside seems to cater directly to westerners, so I had fears that it would be an \"Americanized\", and thus flawed take on rice noodles.  Luckily I was wrong.<br /><br />These are pretty good noodles; they are not that fragile, so you don't need to worry about them breaking apart during preparation or boiling.  Thai Kitchen is an American owned brand, manufactured in China, but it is apparent (and important) that they have a higher standard for quality as I've struggled to find a single broken noodle strand in the boxes I've opened.  Some of the cheaper quality 'mystery brand' chantaboon rice stick noodles I've used in the past have broken when looked at incorrectly.  These noodles are a little bit thicker @ 3mm wide, but a little on the short side @ around 12\" in length.  They take flavors very well and are appropriate for many types of dishes; perfect for stir fry, as the packaging indicates.<br /><br />The only reason I am knocking a star off of these is due to the aforementioned shorter length and because they are a bit starchy, requiring some rinsing (lest you intend to thicken/cloud your sauces and broths).<br /><br />If you have no real asian markets (international isle at Vons doesn't count) near you, these are the ones to get.  If you do have an asian market near you, try a few other brands as well as this one.  You may find that you prefer these.  If you're wondering why someone with a very American name as mine is speaking about these with any kind of authority, it's because I'm asian-american and grew up with no shortage of fantastic, authentic asian cooking at restaurants and at home.

      "My boyfriend and I received the Keurig Elite brewer as a Christmas gift after lusting after the brewers all of my friends and family owned.  We have been using a trusty Cuisinart 10-cup drip brewer for a couple of years now, and while it has served us well, it was a challenge to get a consistent cup of coffee.  Somehow we always ended up on either the too-strong or two-weak side of the line, despite our best efforts to be consistent.<br /><br />I should mention that we are students living on a very strict budget and we knew that the Keurig would end up being a little bit more costly than our Cuisinart.  But we really liked the idea of brewing coffee a cup at a time and cutting down on waste.  Thankfully, my generous sister surprised us with one for Christmas and it has really turned out to be a perfect gift!<br /><br />WARNING!<br /><br />I feel it is important to mention that we almost sent this back.  Considering how I've been singing its praises, I'm sure this is surprising, but there is something that ALL new Keurig owners should be made aware of.  The first maybe six or so cups aren't going to taste quite right.  Apparently this is a common problem.  There is a sort of plastic-y taste going on, even with coffees that don't normally have that fake finish.  It's the newness of the brewer.  Run five cups of straight water through it and then one cup of white vinegar to get rid of this problem.  I can't imagine how many people must have received one of these and then written it off immediately because of this issue.  It's a quick fix and a one-time deal, so be aware of that ahead of time.<br /><br />Now... as I was saying:<br /><br />The Keurig Elite is the entry level of the full size brewers (Keurig also makes a Mini, but we have friends who have had problems with that model).  It has a great water carafe that only needs to be refilled once every six cups (convenient!).  There is no digital display unlike some of the higher end models, but we don't find that a problem.  For those wanting to set up brew times in advance, though, that might be a make-or-break feature.  We manage just fine without it in our household.  It has the two cup sizes and, although they are only two ounces apart in size, the difference between the two can be quite dramatic.  I like a milder cup of coffee while my boyfriend prefers something stronger so I brew on the larger size while he picks the more potent smaller for his cup.<br /><br />When we turn the power on in the morning it takes about 3 minutes for the brewer to heat up and then it really truly does brew the cup in less than a minute.  SO convenient when you want to make a quick cup on your way out the door!  No muss, no fuss.<br /><br />We tried out several pods from the 12 k-cup sample pack the brewer came with (another bonus!) and since then we've also tried out a few of Keurig's other offerings.  It's really hit-and-miss in terms of what you'll like and what will be positively NOT your cup of coffee.  Here are some of the blends we have tried and enjoyed:<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00474OR8G\">Caribou Coffee, Caribou Blend, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a> - Our standard go-to good cup of coffee.  Nothing fancy or amazing, but consistently good flavor.  You can't go wrong with this medium roast.<br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JA5KLM\">Green Mountain Coffee Nantucket Blend, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a> - An alternative to the Caribou Blend that might be easier to find in most stores.  One of the few Green Mountain cups that I've tried and enjoyed.<br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005IPJTZE\">Swiss miss Hot Cocoa K-Cup, Milk Chocolate, 12-Count</a> - The only hot chocolate k-cup we've tried and enjoyed so far.  It is artificially sweetened and you can tell that immediately, but it isn't weak or watery and definitely gets the job done.  Tip: shake the pod before you put it in the machine to loosen the powder.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like about the Keurig and its pod system, however, is that the pods are wasteful and non-recyclable.  Very disappointing.  Keurig is reportedly working on making a recyclable pod, but until that comes out I feel a bit guilty about going through the pods so quickly.  However, there is a solution to this problem!  We picked up the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051SU0OW\">ekobrew Cup, Refillable Cup For Keurig K-Cup Brewers, Brown, 1-Count</a> to use with our brewer!  And it has been perfect!  I'm Canadian so every time I visit home I pick up a big drum of Tim Horton's coffee (the best cheap coffee money can buy) and I can still use it in this little reuseable k cup.  Some reviewers had said that the ekobrew doesn't work with all Keurig models but I can attest to the fact that it works perfectly with the Elite brewer.  Apparently it is leaps and bounds better than Keurig's own reuseable My K Cup pod.  It's definitely worth the $10!<br /><br />Honestly, you really can't go wrong with the Keurig Elite.  We love it as a one-cup brewer without all the bells and whistles and we can't wait to try out the new pods we're set to receive from the included buy 2 get 2 free promotion through Keurig's website.\n",

      "If you (like me) have been looking for the South Beach Living, Protein Fit, Cinnamon Raisin Cereal Bars then this product is what you want. According to the South Beach Living website all of their foods are being \"reimagined\". I'm not sure what that means but ultimately it means that the Protein Cereal Bars have been unavailable at my local grocery stores for some time.<br /><br />I saw these at my local store and decided to give them a try. It turns out that they are identical in size, taste, and nutritional content. After looking at the packaging I can see that they are actually both owned by Kraft Foods and this SnackWell's product is just a rebranding of the exact Protein bars I wanted.<br /><br />The price as of this posting is pretty high here through this Amazon reseller so I recommend asking your local grocer to carry them if they don't already. I know I was glad to find them!<br /><br />Bottom line is, if you're looking for these:<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000K7382A\">South Beach Diet High Protein Cereal Bars, Cinnamon Raisin 5 ea</a><br /><br />Buy these instead:<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004U49R2Y\">Snackwell's Cinnamon Raisin Bars, 6.15-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>\n",

      "Illy issimo caff&egrave; Italian espresso style coffee drink is a 6.8 fl. oz. (200 ml) blast of sweetened caffeine in a can.<br /><br />1930s Italy under the rule of Mussolini greatly contributed to the development of modern coffee culture, improved coffee-making, and new types of coffee-making equipment. The Horn of Africa (where coffee originated) was under Italian colonization and companies such as illy and Bialetti were founded.<br /><br />In that tradition, this drink is now made in Denmark under the issimo brand from illy and distributed in the U.S. by Coca-Cola.<br /><br />This canned cappuccino has a slightly bitter dark roast coffee taste with the right amount of sugar and a pleasant mouthfeel.

      "We have three cats. The two older ones are huge, 10-year-old DSH males, litter mates, who have been separated about 5 days their entire lives and have had just about the best of everything all along. The third is a 5-year-old Siamese male who adopted us as a tiny kitten; he was malnourished and his physical condition showed it when he came to my back porch 4.5 years ago.<br /><br />All are at healthy weights and are active. The big cats are not obese - they're just large cats. I always have dry IAMS available as kibble 24/7, and I give them each a portion of canned food a couple of times a day; they do not ask for food unless they are hungry. The older cats don't like poultry or beef (read: loudly whine for seafood when presented with chicken, in stunned disbelief that I'm not running a restaurant after the 5,391 times they've already complained). The Siamese isn't as picky because he was a stray until he found us. Mushy, gooey loaf? Won't eat it at all. Texture is important.<br /><br />I had not heard of this brand before I saw it here on Amazon.com and I have not seen it locally. Since my little monsters enjoy food, like this <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010B6IFY\">Fancy Feast Gourmet Cat Food Grilled 3-Flavor Variety Pack, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>,  I thought I'd try the 'Subscribe & Save' option for a couple of months to see if they like Petite Cuisine too.<br /><br />Verdict: they're absolutely nuts about it. We call it 'kitty crack' - if there was a rehab or 12-step program for addicted cats, I'd have to send all three of mine for treatment. They can't get enough of it.<br /><br />This is definitely not fish 'flavored' food. The cans are chock full of fish, with tiny shrimp, flaky red snapper, tuna, and whitefish. It smells like fish but it doesn't have a fishy or stale odor. The cans open easily and not much sticks to the bottom and sides of the can - I can just dump food into a bowl without using a utensil to get the last bits out. The aroma and appearance are so good that _I'd_ eat it if I had to do so.<br /><br />I have read and noted concerns about menadione. However, high doses mentioned in some studies aren't equivalent to the small amount contained per portion in this food. To me, the benefits outweigh the risks. Best of all, my Siamese has developed a shiny, thick, ultra-soft coat which he did not have before he started eating this food. He's almost as soft as a chinchilla.<br /><br />In short: looks great, smells great, and I have happy, happy cats. A winner. :-)\n",

      "Most people know that cats can be finicky eaters.  They devour some food and simply walk away from others.  I guess that is one trait that I find most interesting about our three Bengal cats.  They can eat like horses and yet are rather picky about what foods they will eat.  They all like tuna, ham, and even beg for a potato chip from time to time, yet they don't seem to care for turkey and even some types of cheese.  My family and I love our cats very much, and we are concerned about their health and want to feed them nutritious food.  Since all of our Bengals love chicken, I was delighted to recently have the opportunity to try the new Petite Cuisine Chinese Chicken and Chicken Pot Pie Variety Pack.<br /><br />We received a 24 pack, which includes 6 individual boxes, each containing two 3 oz. cans of Sesame Chicken and two 3 oz. cans of Chicken Pot Pie cat food.  The ingredients for each flavor are as follows:<br /><br />Sesame Chicken Entr&eacute;e:  Chicken, Chicken broth, Carrots, Sesame oil, Soy bean oil, Rice, Tricalcium phosphate, Guar gum, Tapioca starch, Calcium sulfate, Salt, Vitamins & Minerals (Vitamin E, Vitamin A, Vitamin D3, Zinc sulfate, Thaimine mononitrate, Manganese sulfate, Menadione sodium bisulfite complex &lt;source of vitamin K>, Riboflavin, Folic acid, Pyridoxine hydrochloride, Copper amino acid complex, Iron amino acid complex), Carrageenan, Choline chloride, Taurine.<br /><br />Chicken Pot Pie Entr&eacute;e:  Chicken, Chicken broth, Sweet Potato, Carrots, Soy bean oil, Tapioca starch, Tricalcium phosphate, Guar gum, Calcium sulfate, Olive oil, Vitamins & Minerals (Vitamin E, Vitamin A, Vitamin D3, Zinc sulfate, Thaimine mononitrate, Manganese sulfate, Menadione sodium bisulfite complex &lt;source of vitamin K>, Riboflavin, Folic acid, Pyridoxine hydrochloride, Copper amino acid complex, Iron amino acid complex), Carrageenan, Choline chloride, Taurine.<br /><br />As you can see, the ingredients in the two flavors are nearly identical.  One controversial ingredient contained in both flavors is Menadione Sodium Bisulfite, which is a synthetic version of vitamin K.  MSB has been called \"potentially harmful\" by many researchers, and is not allowed in human food.  However, the FDA does not restrict the use of MSB in pet foods, and these pet foods are even able to proudly claim \"Natural\" on the label, even if it contains this un-natural ingredient.  Studies indicate that Menadione Sodium Bisulfite can be toxic in high doses, and the tests indicate that this synthetic vitamin supplement can prove toxic to kidneys, lungs, liver, and mucous membranes.  Since I only use the Petite Cuisine food as a supplement to my cat's regular food, I don't consider the levels of MSB to be high enough to put my animals in any danger.  However, it is up to the owner to determine if they find this risk acceptable or not.  You can find more information about Menadione (Vitamin K3) here:<br /> http://www.dogfoodproject.com/index.php?page=menadione<br /><br />The manufacturer website (http://www.petitecuisine.com) says that \"Petite Cuisine is People Food for Cats.\"  There is no wheat gluten, no grain fillers, and no meat byproducts.  The label on the cans says \"Product of Thailand\", and the website boasts that nothing about this food is sourced from China.  All of the meat and vegetables are steam cooked, and each variety is hand packed into each and every can (according to the manufacturer).<br /><br />We have been feeding the Chicken Pot Pie and Sesame Chicken Petite Cuisine entr&eacute;es to our three Bengal cats for the past several days now.  We dispense one can onto a saucer for all three cats to share, once each day.  One thing my wife and I really like about this food is that it doesn't have an unpleasant odor, like most canned pet foods.  It smells like chicken and gravy, and although neither of us are daring enough to try a taste ourselves, our noses tend to support the claim that this is \"people food for cats.\"  The chicken pot pie entr&eacute;e contains several chunks of white meat chicken, along with small bits of sweet potato and carrots, all swimming in an ocean of gravy (or broth, sauce, or whatever you wish to call it).  The food looks good, but I feel that there is just too much gravy, and it could prove to be messy when serving or during feeding.  The sesame chicken entr&eacute;e contains shredded chicken (not chunks), along with bits of carrots and rice in a far more reasonable amount of gravy.  Both entr&eacute;es look good and smell good, but how do the cats like it?  Well as we observed our cats when we served up the food, here is what we found:<br /><br />Chicken Pot Pie Entr&eacute;e:  Asia, our 3 year old female Bengal, greedily devours the hearty chunks of chicken and veggie bits, but leaves most of the gravy behind.  Neo, our 10 month old male Bengal, also enjoys the chicken and licks up quite a bit of the gravy, but doesn't seem at all interested in the bits of sweet potato and carrots.  Matrix, our 2 year old male Bengal always approaches the food, sniffs at it for several seconds, and ultimately walks away without eating any.  Matrix will take a little taste, every now and then, but isn't interested in eating any quantity of it.<br /><br />Sesame Chicken Entr&eacute;e:  Asia again scarfs down the chicken and veggies, but leaves behind the rice and gravy.  Neo seems to eat a little bit of everything.  Matrix again sniffs at the food but will not eat any of it.<br /><br />So overall we have encountered very mixed results with our three cats.  Of course they are cats, so being somewhat finicky is only natural.  Two of the three seem to really enjoy the Petite Cuisine chicken entr&eacute;es, while the third doesn't care for it at all.  So would we buy this variety of Petite Cuisine in the future?  Well I think we will likely try some of the other varieties first, to see if we can get all three cats to enjoy the food.  Petite Cuisine also makes Yellow Fin Tuna, Red Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp, and New England Crab Cake varieties, which all sound like something our cats would like.  We are going to order the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BDDTB2\">Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp) for Cats, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, and see how our cats like these varieties. My wife and I both feel that Petite Cuisine produces great quality food, with high quality ingredients, and we will certainly buy more of their products in the future.  I do admit that I wish they didn't use the synthetic Vitamin K supplement (Menadione), simply because so many others have expressed real concern about the potential risks of this ingredient.  Many other manufacturers have removed this ingredient from their products, so maybe PetPlay, Inc. (makers of Petite Cuisine) will omit this synthetic ingredient in the future if enough consumer concern is expressed.  I do recommend the Petite Cuisine chicken varieties of cat food to other cat owners, but do so with a bit of caution due to the inclusion of the controversial Menadione Sodium Bisulfite ingredient.  If Petite Cuisine tastes as good as it looks and smells, then I am sure all but the most finicky cats will enjoy it a great deal.\n",

      "I purchaed the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BDDTB2\">Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp) for Cats, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BCVY8I\">Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Chinese Chicken & Chicken Pot Pie) for Cats, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.  My cat enjoyed this selection okay, but it seemed like he was much happier with the seafood sampler.  This picture on the box looks like something very similar to human food, but the actual contents weren't as close as I had hoped.  I try more and more to buy food that are more natural and less processed.  These claimed to be full of vitamins and 100 percent of the required nutrition.  That might be the case, but my cat sure didn't get all of his nutrition.  Where as he would drink all of the liquid from the seafood flavors, he didn't much care for the abundance of chicken flavored gravies.  The large amount of gravy and small veggies in the Chicken Pot Pie flavor were not to his liking.  He eventually ate pretty much all of it, but not right away - which for a large cat on a diet like my cat - is ultra rare at my house.  He actually begged for something to eat while he still had the rest of the Chicken Pot Pie in his bowl.<br /><br />This food makes some good claims about the quality and I agree the food does look better than anything you get from a local Superstore for 25 cents a can.  My cat is a 12 year old Tabby Manx with some minor health issues.  His well being is important enough that I will buy better made food instead of just cheap stuff... but when it starts going to waste... and at a higher cost to me?  I consider this to be a one time only purchase and do not plan to reorder even if it's on sale.  Nothing against this company, but I think they would do better with a variety pack of 6-8 flavors with only one chicken flavor for every 5 or so other flavors.  If my cat doesn't like it today, then imagine what it will be like in a week when he has had it 7 days in a row.  More than likely most of these cans will go to the dog just so they won't be completely wasted.<br /><br />If you also tried this pack and your cats turned up their noses to it, then I'd recommend the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack of seafood flavors instead if your cat is more of meat-eater than a vegetable / gravy eater.\n",

      "My cat is addicted to Fancy Feast Elegant Medleys.  It doesn't matter if I buy him expensive or cheap alternatives; he won't touch it unless it has those garden greens!  When I saw the new offerings from Petite Cuisine, I decided to give it a try with him.  After all, they have some veggie content, which I figured might appease his tastes.<br /><br />There are a few things I look for in a wet cat food.  First, I want it to have real ingredients listed.  I don't like for it to have by-products.  (FF:EM does, but he's addicted, so I suppress my concern by giving him great-for-him dry food)  Second, I don't want it to stink.  If it turns my stomach when I open a can, I don't care how much he likes it, I'm not serving it.  Third, it needs to come out of the can easily.<br /><br />Petite Cuisine met or exceeded all of my basic criteria.  Next was the big question:  would my addict take to this new brand?<br /><br />With FF:EM, my cat usually begs for it, sniffs it, and then wanders off.  He returns at his leisure at some point and chows down the whole mass in one sitting.  Occasionally, he will wolf it down immediately. So, consider that the baseline behavior.  He has self-feeding access to dry food, and he gets a 3-oz can of wet food at most twice a day (sometimes he doesn't seem to want the second can).<br /><br />I fed him his first Petite Cuisine can from this box, in Chicken Pot Pie flavor, as his second feeding for the day.  I was surprised that this flavor really seemed like a soup and had real (I'm assuming) pieces of carrot and corn.  It really looks like people food.  He seemed to really enjoy the \"soupy\" broth.  This was his second daily feeding and yet he gulped it down for awhile before wandering off.  He came back later in the evening and finished off the rest.  Success!<br /><br />The next day, I started him with a can of the Sesame Chicken.  It smelled pleasantly like Asian food.  His reaction was to sniff and wander off.  After 12 hours, he hadn't touched it but had eaten a large helping of dry food.  So, he was clearly hungry, but didn't want to touch this flavor.  I washed the remains away and gave him a can of FF:EM.  It was gone within a minute.<br /><br />So, I wondered if he'd just been particularly hungry on the Pot Pie day.  A few mornings later, I did Pot Pie for the morning feeding, and I observed the same behavior.  He drank the broth right away and came back later to finish off the bits.  I also re-tested the Sesame Chicken on a day when I knew he was hungry, and he ignored it steadily.  Clearly, my kitty has preferences.  I have tried some other Petite Cuisine flavors (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BDDTB2\">Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp) for Cats, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>) that are available on Amazon.  He will chow down on Tuna & Shrimp flavor but generally doesn't seem to like the other seafood PC flavors (though he will eat them if left with them, unlike the Sesame Chicken reaction).<br /><br />My point is that my cat is picky, and he will eat at least some flavors of this happily even though he's rejected MANY high-quality foods in the past.  It is nice to have an alternative to the one brand.  I'm also happier with him eating this food given the good ingredients and pleasant appearance and scent.<br /><br />I do want to add/note that there are many folks who are mentioning that the food is more liquid than substance.  That is definitely true for the Pot Pie flavor, but it is not true for Petite Cuisine in general.  The Pot Pie is definitely made to resemble soup.\n",

      "My cat Nigel is very into food. When I opened the first can of Petite Cuisine, he thought he'd died and went to heaven. This was bits of chicken breast, broth and a few very finely chopped vegetables. The chicken pot pie had a more watery broth - the sesame chicken was in a more gravy-like sauce - but both flavors were devoured.<br /><br />My cats are big, outdoorsy cats. They were all once feral. They still frequently bring home a snake, vole or squirrel for entertainment - or supper. I have six: 4 big guys (14-17 pounds) and two slightly smaller girls (11 and 12 pounds).) They appreciate fancy little tidbits of food on a saucer. They especially liked Petite Cuisine.<br /><br />They have free access throughout the day to dry kibble: Purina One Chicken&Rice and Purina Indoor  mixed half and half. We have 3 small <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DI30O\">Petmate Le Bistro Feeders</a> which they love. Then in the evening I feed them 3 ounces each (1/2 can) of Friskies Salmon&Chicken Dinner Shredded. Because the Petite Cuisine cans were so small (3 ounces) I first gave them one can per cat, but that was too much. I split 4 of these tiny cans between six cats and that was just right: no leftovers. They liked the Petite Cuisine better than Fancy Feast or Purina Selects.<br /><br />This package contains 24 cans. 12 cans are pot pie - 12 sesame. The price is comparable to Purina Selects, Fancy Feast or Sheba from the grocery store - but I think the quality is higher. This looks and smells like chicken my Moma cooks! At the end of one week of feeding Petite Cuisine, all of six of them - their fur just glistened.<br /><br />Nigel is plotting: How to work computer and get Petite Cuisine on auto-subscribe shipment from Amazon? Hmmmmm? Bodhi just wants the A-4 Smiley Box* it comes in!<br /><br />* A-4 Smiley Box - the new cat sleeping container that is delivered almost weekly by the man wearing brown.

      "First of all, your cat should hopefully like fish-flavored foods, because obviously this variety pack is all seafood - yellowfin, snapper, tuna, and shrimp. And if your cat is picky about which fish he/she likes, you won't be breaking the bank by discarding the cans of the flavors he/she doesn't approve of. There is also a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BCVY8I\">chicken variety pack</a> available by Petite Cuisine, which contains Chinese chicken and chicken pot pie dishes. Give that a try if your cat is simply a lover of all foods.<br /><br />The food actually could pose as human food if someone was unaware they were being served cat food. But do yourself a favor and just buy a can of tuna or whatever it is you like - leave the cat food to the cats. The dishes are quite moist with chunks of meat/fish and broth. They are a source of protein and are hearty enough to serve as one meal for a small cat. You may try adding dry food if one can isn't enough. Or simply use two cans and order more as necessary.\n",

      "I actually got this package as a \"Black Friday\" deal on Amazon, so my price was even lower than the one posted here. I couldn't believe that they had it on the sugar-free variety pack! So 6 bottles for less than 2 bottles, with my Amazon Prime ... was a deal I couldn't resist.<br /><br />My favorites are the Raspberry, Vanilla, and Chocolate, although I also enjoy the other three flavors.<br /><br />If you aren't familiar with the Torani syrups, they are an excellent addition to your coffee, your frappes, your oatmeal, your hot chocolate:  almost anything you sweeten, you can add a little Torani flavor. And unlike the creamy texture of other liquid chocolates, these are \"clear.\"  In fact, if you ask for a squirt of flavor at your local coffee shop, most likely you will receive it from one of the Torani bottles!<br /><br />This summer I bought the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002FWMF8G\">Mr. Coffee BVMC-FM1 20-Ounce Frappe Maker</a> and started making Ice Blended coffee at home. While I love using the flavored coffees, it is difficult to find my favorites locally in a decaf blend. It is also impossible to find most of the Torani sugar-free flavors locally, which I need as a diabetic. So throw some of this in with my regular decaf, and WOW!!! I'm in love.<br /><br />Note - The one kind available in my local grocery store is a 12-oz bottle for $5, comparing to  than $10 for each of these bottles. Do be cautious if you are buying the single bottles on Amazon - which run much higher than that. However, this variety pack works out to a fantastic price.<br /><br />Great Taste - Great Price - Great Product.

      "I ordered <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003PFWNSE\">Torani Variety Pack, Regular, 25.36-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)</a>.  I had never tried Torani products before and I had wanted to try them as I heard good things about their sugar free syrups.  I have tried 4 of the flavors that I thought I would like.  They are so good that I have trouble believing that they are SUGAR FREE and FAT FREE!<br /><br />My two favorite flavors are Vanilla and Hazelnut. I stopped using fattening products in my coffee and stopped buying lattes and cappuccinos because they are so fattening.  However, my coffees were now so ordinary that I practically stopped drinking coffee.  Torani syrups changed all that! Both the Torani Vanilla and Torani Hazelnut are so incredibly good tasting, that they turn my so-so coffee into a lattee-like drink.  Wow!  It is hard to believe these syrups are sugar free and low in calories! The Torani Chocolate appears to be an equally good product although I was disappointed when it did not enhance my coffee.  Torani Chocolate is very strong which means that you should add less than you do with the Vanilla and Hazelnut flavors.  For Vanilla and Hazelnut, I add about 1/2 to 1 oz of syrup to a very large (12 oz) coffee.  Putting the same amount of Chocolate in coffee did not enhance the flavor.  In other types of shakes, I will probably use less than the usual amount of Chocolate.  I think it might be better in milk shakes.  Since I love Chocolate as a flavor, I should be able to find good uses for it.  I also love the Raspberry flavor in iced tea and it adds an interesting twist to lemonade.  I think Raspberry will be good with other fruity flavors.  Although I am disappointed in a few of the flavor bottles that came with this 6 pack, I am basically happy with the purchase.  The bottles that are good are REALLY GOOD!  Additionally, purchasing all 6 varieties gave me the chance to try a number of different Torani SF syrups that are yummy and let me know which to choose and which to avoid. I probably will not like either the Irish Creme or Classic Caramel flavors because I am not partial to these flavors by any beverage maker.  I will probably not open them and give these flavors away to someone who will appreciate them more than me.\n",

      "\"Rich Tea\" are the quintessential English tea-time biscuit, to be served mid-afternoon with a fine cup of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F3WS7K\">English Tea</a> (taken with milk, not lemon). And McVitie make the finest \"Rich Tea\", having exactly the correct texture and firmness and delicate flavour which these biscuits should have. \"Rich Tea\" are also the ultimate dunking biscuits, for which purposes they must, of course, be entirely whole and not cracked even in the slightest, otherwise they will instantly fall in half and disappear to the bottom of the cup. Even whole, these biscuits present the maximum challenge to the dunker -- leave the biscuit in the tea just a fraction of a second too long and, again, you'll wonder where your biscuit went (and why you have blotting paper at the bottom of your cup).  [American readers please note that dunking is, of course, entirely frowned upon in English high society, as an activity undertaken only by the peasant classes. It is thus to be indulged in only when entirely alone and in the privacy of one's own home, when there is no danger of being observed by the servants.]<br /><br />Should your biscuits arrive broken, as may, unfortunately, be all too likely (as these are a fragile biscuit and McVitie's packaging consists of no more than a paper wrapper) do not despair; all is not lost. Simply tip a quantity of the broken biscuits into a bowl and pour hot milk over them. The result may look like soggy blotting paper, but the eating experience is exquisite!\n",

They are tied for time to get all the treats out!<br /><br />This cannot be played with on tile or wood floors - too noisy for people and jug slides too much for dogs.

I added some <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CSAJ96\">small tennis balls</a> to the jug and then threw the kibble in on top of it. That helped in 2 ways. First, the kibble didn't spill out of the neck while I was filling it from the bottom. Second, it slowed down the amount of time it took our dog to empty it (about half an hour).<br /><br />Just a word of warning: you will have kibble all over your floor until the dog goes back to eat it up.

The Tug a Jug just does not work at all for him, though. I put tiny treats in there and it is physically impossible for him to get the treats out. If you're lucky, the rope will catch on one of the treats and you might be able to wiggle one out that way, but that would still require him to be holding the jug and tugging the rope which hardly ever happens. If that doesn't work, you have to tip the jug to get anything out and, well, my dog can't do that since he doesn't have thumbs.

Not because it's hard to understand how it works just because it's very hard to get the treats out even for me, even when he shakes it. The rope (too thick)prevents the treats from falling out.. and even when I removed the rope, the shape of the bottle makes it difficult as the kibbles roll inside but that's pretty much it, they barely ever get passed the neck.

I have both the small and medium sizes, which actually both work well for my 50 pound dog but I change them based on the size of kibble I feed.<br /><br />I like that they changed from the plastic-type \"rope\" which could easily be chewed and swallowed, but I don't like the new cotton rope - it's simply too difficult to clean and doesn't dry quickly enough.  I cut it off, purchased a piece of non-toxic acrylic rope, and have been satisfied (just have to tie the ends and burn them so they don't unravel).<br /><br />Kind of a pain to have to get a different rope and wish they would change it, but the replacement only cost me 50 cents.  The jug itself is more durable in the medium size than small, but I use it in a crate that has thick soft bedding now and has lasted almost a year so far.

      "I've been using stevia products for ten (?) years, and I like Stevita Toffee.  Of the two brands of the *naturally* flavored stevia liquids (the other manufacturer's stevia liquids come in glass bottles and are super-pricey, and then there's this Stevita liquid), the Stevita Vanilla and Stevita Toffee are the best for coffee, bar none.  I use the Strawberry (and other flavors) for milk, protein shales, etc.  Anyway, I think the Toffee's taste is about 2/3's as good as the Vanilla, but it's also stronger . . . stronger smell and taste.  I can see why others didn't like it, but I'm very used to stevia's taste--plus I don't use stevia on its own.  I recommend 15 drops of Stevita Vanilla or Toffee, plus two teaspoons of the (naturally flavored) Hazelnut Agave (available on Amazon <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UVKX9C\">Madhava Pure Organic Agave Nectar, Hazelnut Flavor, 11.75-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 6)</a>), and one-half a packet of Equal or Splenda, plus cream.  It makes a (mostly) healthy version of any \"special\" coffee drink at Starbucks, and tastes as good or better.  Believe me, that combo I just listed is *fantastic*.  (BTW, I give five stars to the Vanilla-flavored version of Stevita, and four stars to this Toffee version).\n",

      "I just tried this Puroast Low Acid Coffee and from first impressions the coffee is very nice and the low acid nature helps with the sour-y aftertaste that I generally experience when drinking black coffee.<br /><br />I tried the coffee several different ways; black , with cream & sugar, and even with condensed milk.  The coffee was made in a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GTR2F6\">Keurig B-70 B70 Platinum Single-Cup Home Brewing System</a> with the my Solofill Cup, Refillable K-Cup For Keurig K-Cup Brewers, Red k-cup filter that allows me to use the coffee of my choice.  In all instances I filled the my k-cup to the brim of the filler pod and gently tapped but not tamping the grounds.  the water temperature is set to the max (which i believe is about 208° F) and made the largest serving available.  This is how I usually drink my coffee in the morning whether in a my k-cup or using the disposable kcups so its the best for me to judge the difference.<br /><br />Even in the largest serving, the coffee is still plenty bold and has great aroma and body.  I generally avoid drinking black coffee because of that acidic aftertaste that I don't particularly like.  That is the reason that I generally use both cream and sugar.  With this low acid blend, I can definitely drink this black if that's what I'm in the mood for.\n",

I have heartburn and acid reflux, currently treated by OTC acid reducers, and while I've found that certain foods and beverages seem to increase my symptoms, coffee doesn't appear to be one of them, especially since I experience my worst symptoms at night but only drink coffee in the morning (for the caffeine).  (Perhaps this product would make more sense in the decaffeinated version: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004JQXB66\">Puroast Low Acid Coffee Natural Decaf Dark French Roast Grind Drip Grind, 0.75-Pound Bags (Pack of 2)</a> or the half decaffeinated version: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004JQR7FM\">Puroast Low Acid Coffee Half Caff Dark French Roast Grind Drip Grind, 12 oz Bags (Pack of 2)</a>.)<br /><br />My single 3 oz sample bag (purchasers will receive 10 bags) arrived only partially sealed, a rather surprising lapse in packaging that one hopes is uncommon.  Nevertheless, there remained enough coffee to produce several cups.  Taste and aroma seemed fine to me; in fact I detected no difference from regular gourmet coffees, but for the reasons stated above I also detected no change in my symptoms.<br /><br />In sum I think this a specialized product truly suitable only for noticeably acid symptomatic coffee lovers (you know who you are), and I would encourage them to give it a try and see if it helps (and still tastes worth drinking).

      "It's hard to review for this 3-ounce bag of coffee for two reasons; 1) three ounces is not a lot of joe to go by, and 2) the tests were performed in a brand new <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002YPC2NM\">EZ-Cup for Keurig Coffee Machines By Perfect Pod</a>, but let me share the experience with you.<br /><br />First of all, if you have problems with acidic coffee, the chances are good your problems are not as bad as my Dad's issues with it.  He was the test subject because he loves coffee, and can rarely drink it.  He's had 2/3rds of his stomach removed... TWICE.  He's also had Barrett's Esophagus, and has undergone procedures to literally burn the potentially cancerous stuff from his throat.  His sensitivities to acidic foods or beverages are, as you can imagine, severe.  So when I saw a product sample offered on Amazon recently, I jumped at the opportunity for him.<br /><br />He was able to make two cups of coffee using the new K-Cup Pod, but reviews are incomplete because the experimentation with the amount to put in the K-Cup is complete.  There were no instructions as to amount to use on the package of coffee, so we had to guess by dead reckoning (to be honest and fair, even if we'd used a regular brewer, we still weren't sure how much water to put with the three ounces... we imagined that it would have been six.  So we looked at a video on YouTube from Perfect Pod which showed how much they put in, and we followed suit.  What came out, was, according to my Dad, ironically \"weak.\"  We probably should have put in more, but the portion we'd used was exactly half the bag, so we didn't have enough left to try it again.  On the positive side, he suffered no ill effects from what he ingested, so that's a promising prospect..<br /><br />My Dad and I have ordered a one-pound bag of Puroast coffee to try again, this time the House Blend.  I will make a point of returning once we've had the time to test it, and I will update as soon as possible!\n",

But then so is coffee made with a cold toddy tool like: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006H0JVW\">Toddy T2N Cold Brew System</a>.

      "Yesterday's mail brought from amazon.com's VINE program a free 3-ounce sample of PUROAST LOW ACID COFFEE, Dark French Roast.<br /><br />My wife and I tried it before, during and after breakfast this morning (2 mugs apiece so far).<br /><br />-- (1) How I prepared the coffee drink.<br /><br />My wife and I had had a late dinner yesterday evening at the monthly meeting of Asheville-Blue Ridge Torch Club in a first class local Hotel. In my case my main course was a stew based around a fatty cut of short ribs of beef. When I woke this morning, I fet mild stomach discomfort, and first reached for a GAVISCON-brand  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G7QR76\">Gaviscon Extra Strength Chewable Antacid Tablets, Original Flavor, 100-Count Bottles (Pack of 2)</a> stomach soother. An hour our so later my wife and I began sampling the PUROAST Low Acid Coffee. I prepared the drink  in in our MR COFFEE-brand drip coffee maker. I decided to do it exactly as I normally do with FOLGER's or other brands, aiming at ten cups of coffee based on three scoops of the ground beans. Those three scoops used up about 3/5 of the contents of our free sample. I will try the rest tomorrow.<br /><br /> And here are the agreed opinions of us both:<br /><br />-- (2) PUROAST coffee felt very soothing in the stomach - immediately. Here was something better than any other coffee we had ever tried. Here, a couple of hours later, I am still grateful for a sense that PUROAST soothed my agitated innards. This is a quality to build the brand around, no doubt.<br /><br />-- (3) Neither wife nor I found the taste pleasant. It was far from vile. We didn't feel compelled to stop drinking. As I write, I am still sipping my second mug. I am no expert on evaluating coffees, but if I put my mind to it I could probably describe five different flavor sensations. My wife and I discussed our sensations.<br /><br />First, I asked her: \"Does this remind you of POSTUM <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005DGQK1Y\">1904 Vintage Ad Postum Coffee Substitute Caffeine Free - Original Print Ad</a>? -- a drink I don't like. She: POSTUM tastes better. To me the underlying flavor reminds of POSTUM, a very STRONG POSTUM.<br /><br />Second, it tasted bitter in the mouth, though felt soothing in the stomach.<br /><br />Third, something reminds of wood shaving being turned into charcoal.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: My wife and I are both tempted to explore further the concept of \"low acid coffee\" and to order other varieties from the company's website:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />We are keeping an open mind. In my case I hope to find another blend that reminds me a bit more of coffee and a bit less of POSTUM.<br /><br />-OOO-\n",

      "I should let you know what I usually drink for coffee. I like bold, dark roasted Indonesian coffees. I usually drink a particular blend from Starbucks, what they call Komodo Dragon.  I've found other coffees that I like, from various sources, but this particular coffee can be drunk black, unsweetened, and it is missing a layer of nasty bitterness that is pretty uniform in Central American washed coffees.  About the only new world coffees that are missing some of this nasty layer are Brazils - Santos has its own problems but the layer of bitterness that the Central American washed coffees have is at least partially gone.<br /><br />That coffee is a blend that has changed over time.  At its height, it was a five star coffee, now it varies between 4.5 and 4.75 stars, not reaching 5 stars anymore, but almost everything else is just so bad that I can't drink it.  I've had other Indonesian blends, they are missing the nasty bitterness that you find in so much of the standard coffee that many people just love, and which are highly rated.<br /><br />What Komodo Dragon does have, on its better days, is depth, complexity. There is a bold coffee flavor, of course, but there are other things going on. When I drink it, the second sip is different from the first one. The third sip is different from the second.<br /><br />So I was prepared to hate this coffee, and then after a couple of sips of this coffee, I was prepared to like it...and it just left me...wanting...something, some depth, some complexity.  The best coffees - again, my favorite Indonesians, have more than just coffee flavor. As you sip the coffee, there is coffee flavor, and then there is another layer of flavor, like when you drink a good single malt islay scotch, or a fine port that has cost you 50 bucks for a bottle and you don't regret it, even if you only can afford to buy a couple bottles a year...there is grape and then there is fruit, berries, flowers, fields of heather for Scotch, or groves of cork trees for Port.<br /><br />With coffee, there are faults, like if you can smell the shed, or the burlap sack that the coffee was moved in, and then there are positives, like when there is a layer of chocolate in the coffee and you have not put any chocolate in, or when there is a satiety factor - you drink a cup of black coffee and it is so flavorful, so complex that you start hungry and you end not hungry.<br /><br />Now this coffee is workmanlike - it has coffee in it, the blend has almost no bad flavors, no flaws. It is actually missing a lot of the bad flavors, bitterness, that I dislike in Central American washed coffee that everyone drinks in ground coffee these days. And if I went into a restaurant, I would be pleased to get a cup of coffee of this quality.<br /><br />But in terms of possibly replacing the coffee I drink everyday? No, not yet.  Do NOT get me wrong. I do get acid stomach, acid reflux some time. If my acid reflux was caused by coffee, and I could drink this without it kicking my acid into high gear, I would thank my lucky stars that I had stumbled into a coffee of this quality that I could drink.<br /><br />Many years ago, there was a commercial low acid coffee, it was sold under the Kava brand (It was not the mildly narcotic drink from Fiji. Not <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0892817267\">Kava: The Pacific Elixir: The Definitive Guide to Its Ethnobotany, History, and Chemistry</a>, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SAVJ4W\">Kava, Instant Coffee, 4-Ounce (12 Pack)</a>). I see that it is still available, at least as instant coffee. It is as bad as any instant coffee is, with no redeeming social value other than it is a low acid coffee, suitable for people who love coffee and can't drink it.<br /><br />This is a HUGE step up from that.<br /><br />So that is how this coffee gets four stars.  On the scale of acid neutralized coffees I know about, there is Kava, which might or might not be mostly Vietnamese Robusta, and then there is this stuff, which, if all you had tasted was American supermarket instant coffee, or stuff like Maxwell House<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002C4BOHK\">Maxwell House French Roast (Medium Dark) Ground Coffee, 33-Ounce Jugs (Pack of 2)</a>, would be nectar of the gods.<br /><br />I can't give it 5 stars, though. A five star coffee is going to have complexity, it is going to have depth, it is going to have a wonderous deep, level that is as much more than coffee as a fine single malt is more than Jack Daniels.<br /><br />If coffee were whiskey, this coffee is more than Jack Daniels, but it is sort of Canadian Club.  It stops short of the heights that it would take for me to rate it five stars - nothing bad, but nothing exceptionally good.\n",

      "I have tried this coffee hot and iced,with milk and black and I tested the pH.  Frankly it won't qualify as a great cup of coffee.  The flavor is burnt (like Starbucks dark roast) but is flat and it lacks middle notes and vanillins (unlike Starbucks.)  Perhaps flavors other than French Roast would be better at providing complexity as that frequently comes from Colombian roast in a blend. The aroma is underwhelming.<br /><br />The pH of the Puroast coffee tested at 6.5, slightly acidic (neutral is 7 on a scale of 0-14.0) but less so than normal coffee.  Normal coffee ranges from around 5.0 - 5.1, more neutral than beer or any fruit juice and similar to carbonated water. If you can drink those, then your stomach isn't reacting to the acidity but something else. So normal coffee, whether it irritates you or not, isn't all that acidic.  Acidity generally refers to a flavor note in coffee rather than pH and coffee without acid flavor notes tastes flat.  Irritation may instead come from the essential oils in the beans or the caffeine.<br /><br />(Having too much stomach acid has exactly the same symptoms as too little stomach acid and most people over 35 are slightly deficient in hydrochloric acid and 50% of people over 50 are seriously hypochlorhydric, but we are taught to regard the symptoms as being from acidity. Your Tums work by other mechanisms, beyond the scope of this review.)<br /><br />So while Puroast is attempting to solve an acid/base problem that doesn't significantly exist, the fact that the flavor is low probably means that the essential oils in the beans are lowered as well, making the coffee less irritating.  Frankly I'd rather add about 20% chicory to good coffee, which slightly sweetens the taste and is less irritating.  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001M11HI\">Frontier Natural - Chicory - Roasted, 1 lbs</a>Is it worth giving up flavor to drink coffee?

      "Got to hand it to them - it is a smooth cup of coffee. My sample was the Dark French Roast. Normally I do not care much for French Roast because it is over cooked in my opinion.<br /><br />I drank it black to get a good sense of the flavor. Since it is darkly roasted it doesn't have a lot of subtle tones to it like lighter roasts have. It has the twang that this level of roast imparts on coffee and, of course, a strong coffee flavor. I tend to drink my coffee a bit on the strong side anyway - a tablespoon heaped a little per ~12 oz of water.<br /><br />For the last several years I've been brewing my coffee a cup at a time with a Melitta #4 filter and a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001794Q0S\">Melitta Ready Set Joe/Mug 64010 Coffee Makers Speciality</a> (although I bought just the filter cone) and an electric kettle. If you've never tried it this method is the only way you'll get a great cup of coffee every single time. I had a liter thermos and a different filter cone and brewed it by the pot this way too. Excellent coffee every time.<br /><br />At any rate, I mention that to say this - for pre-ground coffee this is a pretty good cup of coffee. I'd be willing to bet that the Columbian roast is excellent too.<br /><br />For those of you that think 'eh coffee is coffee' I've got two words for you ... 'Chase Sanborn' Ug. Awful stuff with a chemical flavor.<br /><br />I have to say that the low acid claim seems to be exactly right. I got the sample in the mail today and just made a cup around 3:30 in the afternoon. Sort of late for me to drink coffee and on a mostly empty stomach but I don't feel like I need to drink a bunch of water to dilute the coffee.<br /><br />I like it. Give it a try.

My usual coffee is <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002Y2QTTI\">Community Coffee Ground Coffee, French Roast, 32-Ounce Bags (Pack of 2)</a>. I'd actually prefer to drink <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5O4G\">Starbucks French Roast Coffee (Extra Bold), Whole Bean, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)</a>, but I just can't afford it. So, I like French roast, which has a darker, bolder flavor, and I thought I'd give this coffee a try.<br /><br />I would rate the flavor of this coffee as middling. It didn't have that paint-thinner flavor that cheap coffees have (I'm looking at you Folgers). But it also didn't have the depth and richness that I associate with high-quality French roasts. Not a lot of body in this coffee (body is that heaviness on the tongue). Most French roasts have much more body, but some people might prefer this coffee because it has less. Taste-wise, this coffee is also fairly low in acidity (which you would expect from the brand), but low acidity is characteristic of most French roasts. I don't know how much easier this will be on the sensitive stomach.<br /><br />My guess is that if your stomach has serious acid problems, then this coffee will still be too much for it. If you just get a little sour stomach, you might be able to handle some other brands, and trial and error should lead you to the right one. I hesitate to recommend this coffee because of the price. You're paying a premium price for a middling flavor. I think most people  with acid sensitivity should be able to find a better coffee they can stomach for the same price or a much cheaper option with the same flavor. But, if you try this coffee and it works for you, enjoy. It's not a bad coffee; I just didn't find its flavor outstanding.\n",

We opened each box, finding all cookies in the same condition -- messed up chocolate sticking to the package, cookies overtly sticky.  If I can find these in a b&m store, I'll update, but won't order online again. Trader Joe's triple ginger cookies have a better texture and taste so we'll have a piece of dark chocolate with those for the desired combination. I may try dipping those cookies in melted bittersweet chocolate, leaving an edge free for easy holding.\n",

      "These are the greatest crackers, either alone, or with a slice of cheese, or with a dip.  There's just enough wasabi to spice up what could otherwise be a dull-tasting rice cracker.

Go figger.  So it's great to have Amazon supply our \"cracker fix\" when we travel to the many places where these crackers seem to be extinct.<br /><br />By the way, they are also gluten-free, if you care about that.  Some folks think avoiding gluten, even if you're not actually allergic to it, can help weight control.  I look at it a different way - these crackers are only 7 calories each, and satisfying far beyond their calories - so they're sort of a diet food.\n",

      "Pork has a tendency to dry out during cooking, and Shake N Bake does a very good job keeping all the juices sealed into the meat. Toss your chops in a plastic bag with a packet of Shake N Bake until coated, pop them in the oven and 15 minutes later, you have juicy pork chops with a satisfying crunch you can usually only get from frying.<br /><br />Shake N Bake would be the perfect pork enhancing product if it has a little more taste to it. The ingredients name dried onions, extractives (?) of paprika, and the very descriptive term - spice. I don't know could possibly be included in this secret spice because a Shake N Bake pork chop tastes very close to a regular pork chop with a plain breadcrumb coating.<br /><br />Shake N Bake is quick, easy to use and results in a decent, albeit bland, piece of pork. Good for kids and picky eaters. For those looking juicy pork chops with more zest, I'd suggest <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QYJDNS\">McCormick Bag 'n Season Pork Chops, 1.06oz (Pack of 10)</a>.\n",

      "Shake N Bake in the original pork flavor has been a guilty pleasure of mine since I was a little girl. When I was a kid, it was often what I would request for my birthday dinner and I still crave Shake N Bake pork chops every now and then.<br /><br />When I selected the Shake N Bake Pork Pouch, I really wasn't sure what it was. I thought maybe it was a pouch that you put the pork chop in and cooked it in the pouch. I was completely wrong.<br /><br />The pouch is just a packet of the Shake N Bake mix. That's it. There is no little plastic bag to shake the chops in, so you have to provide your own bag. Not only that, but the pouch is only 2.25-ounces, as opposed to the 3-ounce packets you get in the standard Shake N Bake box, so it coats fewer pork chops. To be fair, it does state on the back of the pouch that this packet makes 4-6 pork chops instead of the 6-8 chops the 3-ounce packet makes.<br /><br />For me, this just isn't something I am very interested in, with one exception. I confess I am one of those people who like extra Shake N Bake on my pork chops. I often use 1 ½ - 2 packets for 6-8 pork chops. The Shake N Bake pouch would be handy to use along with one of the 3-ounce packets to accommodate my desire for extra Shake N Bake.<br /><br />As for the flavor, it is the same Shake N Bake Original Pork flavor I know and love. There are no changes to the flavor, just the packaging.<br /><br />I haven't found these in any of my local grocery stores yet, but they can be ordered through Amazon. I honestly don't know that I would buy these. I just don't see a need for these pouches and will stick to the normal box of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1HVVQ\">Shake 'N Bake Seasoned Coating Mix, Original Pork, 6-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>.\n",

      "Always on the lookout for a new coffee adventure, I took the plunge with this very expensive grind (almost $2/oz!), based upon all the glowing reviews here. The verdict: Huh? What kind of crummy coffee are the ***** rating reviewers comparing this to that it supposedly tastes so \"out of this world\"? After the first cup (brewed using my <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G71J6G\">Swissgold KF 300 One-Cup Coffee Filter</a> in my <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000REZVW6\">Trudeau Board Room Desk Mug, Brown Leatherette</a>, using the recipe I've used for every other cup I've ever brewed, I thought: \"Jeez, this stuff tastes kinda flat and a bit burned!\" I backed off the amount I used in my next cup, which slightly improved the taste, but then it seemed like it was a bit weak, and therefore intolerable. About the only thing going for it is that it is not bitter tasting.<br /><br />The container in which the coffee comes is neat, though -- a plastic-lined, screw-on lid topping a stylish can -- and I'll get some good use out of it for storing other items once I've finished with this stuff. But I'm here to tell ya that this coffee is most definitely not worth the lofty price.<br /><br />One more problem: This stuff is ground to a near-powder consistency. It tends to clog any drip filter as when wet it becomes like a lump of tar.<br /><br />My recommendation for a truly great, flavorful cup o' java: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007G96XO\">100% Colombia Supremo</a>. For nominally one-third the price of this illy stuff (I've even bagged it on sale at my local Safeway for &lt;$4 for a 12 oz. can!), you get a way tasty cup of fine Columbian coffee. The Don Francisco 100% Colombia Supremo coffee is still the best I've ever tasted -- at any price.<br /><br />'nuff said.\n",

      "I'm on a diet and there are times when I just want something crunchy. But I also have high blood pressure so a lot of snacks that I use as a treat are too high-sodium for me. I eat rice cakes with peanut butter or cottage cheese once in a while and I happened to see Popchips on Amazon.com. These <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RVAWY0\">Popchips Original Potato Chips, 0.8-Ounce Single Serve Bags (Pack of 24)</a> were advertised at a special price and all the flavored ones were sold out, so I decided to try the original flavor. After trying my first bag I have a few comments.<br />1. Great service - I ordered them on 1/27, and they were delivered on 2/3, with no damage to the packaging.<br />2. I like the 24-pack that are individual servings because that helps me regulate portion control.<br />3. As a previous reviewer noted they do taste somewhat like Pringles - whether that's good or bad is up to individual tastes.<br />4. The nutritional information isn't terrible: a serving has 100 calories, 3 grams of fat with no cholesterol or saturated/trans fat, and only 160 mg.sodium; Pringles also contains 160 mg of sodium but has 150 calories and 9 grams of fat, as compared to potato chips with an average of 150 calories, 180 mg. sodium, and 10 grams fat, and pretzels with 110 calories, 450 mg sodium, and 1 gram fat.<br />5. They are kind of dry and bland, but are delicious with salsa - I really liked them with Costco's peach mango salsa! I don't have cottage cheese in the house so I couldn't try that. And I think peanut butter wouldn't be good unless something \"wet\" like sugar-free jam or jelly is also added.<br />I just got them so I'm not sure if I'll reorder another box; I think I'm going to next order Amazon's 6-flavor variety pack (4 Original Potato, 4 BBQ, 4 Salt & Pepper, 4 Sea Salt & Vinegar, 4 Sour Cream & Onion, 4 Cheddar)before deciding. I would give them 3 stars if my review was just based on taste; I'm giving 4 stars because I really want to like them because they're more healthy and I can think of lots of healthy foods to use them with - why not tuna,, egg salad, etc?\n",

It's now the third Van Houtte k-cup I've tried and I've been pleased with every choice, but most pleased with this one. I added a packet of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QV8HMQ\">Stevia Supreme-50pkts - 1.8 oz - Packet</a> and some half and half and it's a wonderful dessert coffee.<br /><br />I feel this is a much better option than those sugar laden artificially flavored non-dairy coffee creamers. My top two flavored k-cups are now <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001WRHQRA\">Green Mountain 15535 Pumpkin Spice K-Cups, Light, 18 pods</a> and this one.<br /><br />I hope this winter that they come out with a peppermint k-cup!\n",

      "I purchased the Kyjen Dog Games Paw Hide Treat Toy.  Labs are exceptionally smart and I try to give mine, Autumn, a variety of challenging toys.  She loves her chew toys but she needs to be challanged.  First of all she found her toy under the tree wrapped and without a treat in it.  How did she do that?  With encouragement we allowed her to open her toy.  I took it away after she examined it.  While she wasn't looking I put a few treats in a few of the compartments.  It took her a few minutes to figure it out.  Next time, no challange at all.  That is why I only gave it 4 stars.  It was too easy, but I think to some dogs it will be great, others fustrating.<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043A71PU\">Kyjen Dog Games Paw Hide Treat Toy</a>\n",

      "<span class=\"tiny\"> Length:: 1:39 Mins<br /><br /></span>(* this review was originally posted for the 3 oz size, a verified purchase by me on Amazon)<br /><br />I purchased three well reviewed brands of catnip for Tristan, my six month old Savannah cat. In the video, I have just placed down three plates of catnip from freshly opened packages. The brands from left to right are <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00028HN5A\">Sojos Certified Organic Catnip</a>, in the middle is the product in this listing - Cosmic Catnip (this video review shows the 3oz jar), and on the far right we have <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VNEII0\">Frontier Catnip Leaf & Flower C/s Certified Organic, 16 Ounce Bag</a>.<br /><br />Like the little bear at Goldilock's table, Tristan tries a bit from each plate; at the end of this clip he seemed to have no *overwhelming* preference for any particular brand though. As far as his physical reactions to each (sampled separately), he did not act \"stoned\" nor hyper, he merely scratches on his scratch pad a bit more with catnip than without catnip and gives himself a good stretch. He also strongly prefers catnip infused mice to non-catnip mice and I'm happy to oblige.<br /><br />As as far which *I* prefer, if it's all the same to the cat (and it seems that it is) here's my take on things -<br /><br />The Frontier brand is by far the least expensive at just under fifteen dollars for 16oz. It is slightly more coarse and seems to have a little bit of stems mixed in. VERY fragrant though and turned out to be a close second favorite of the cat reviewing the products. I would definitely buy the Frontier brand again and use it for stuffing toys generously or for \"marinating\" his little cloth mice. Organic and suitable even for human consumption if you like it as a tea.<br /><br />The Sojos brand (1oz can) is the most expensive - by my calculations comes to over a hundred dollars for 16oz!. The description says it produces a \"harmless, euphoric state\" but we saw no evidence of that. Smelled fresh but definitely a milder aroma than the other two brands; had the finest chopped leaves of the three. Hand harvested if that is important you or your cat.<br /><br />With the Cosmic Cat brand, we *may* have a winner.....<br /><br />When the camera was off, Tristan returned to the Cosmic Cat sample several times more so than the other brands. I repeated this little taste test for the next two days and Cosmic Cat had a small but definite edge over the competition. I'd have to say that I agree with his choice; the Cosmic Cat brand leaves are darker and more fragrant than the other two brands. The leaves are also cut just right - not too fine/not too large, and no stems or coarse pieces. I find the Cosmic Cat brand's price reasonable, the storage container is very convenient, and the 3oz* size is enough not to be too little and not so much to get stale and spoil.<br /><br />Hope you find this information useful in choosing for your own cat or kitten.\n",

      "I have gone through several <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018N1DRW\">KONG Naturals Premium Catnip, 2-Ounce</a> jars.  Looking for a bit more value, I decided to try Cosmic Catnip.  I don't typically like to change a good thing but went with it. I have house cats and also care for some free-roaming cats. Both populations react favorably to the product. For the house cats, I sprinkle some in their cat beds and on their toys and they roll around, sometimes head over heels. It is quite amusing to watch. However, I think the cats are more interested in the Kong product; they seem to spend greater periods of time playing with it and sniffing it.  In my house, that means more exercise and that is something I like to promote.<br /><br />Cosmic's catnip is packaged in a #3 plastic container, which is not as easily recyclable as a #1 or #2 plastic in most areas. The product's packaging also indicates that it is grown in North America, so that may mean outside of the United States. (For the record, Kong's catnip comes in a #1 PETE container that is easily recyclable and its catnip is also grown in North America).<br /><br />Would I purchase it again?  My cats like it but there is no reason to use a container that is only sometimes recyclable for catnip.  Additionally, my cats liked the Kong product a bit more.  I will likely stick with that when it is time to repurchase.\n",

      "This product converted me, I kid you not. Before: I did not think I liked instant coffee. Now: I think I do! :-)<br /><br />I've tried <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E50TSS\">International Coffee</a> type products, which are powdered drink mixes and not truly instant coffee, and I was never very impressed. Eventually, I learned (and you'll laugh at me for not knowing this) that instant coffee is not a \"mix\" like hot chocolate but actually coffee beans treated differently in their production from coffee beans intended to be brewed. The bean is roasted as usual, then crushed (rather than cut as for brewing beans) in preparation for creating a coffee \"concentrate\" that will then be either freeze dried or spray dried. This product (as explained on the Nescafe website) is Robusta and Arabica beans, freeze dried, a method which may or may not be the top choice for connoisseurs of instant coffee, but being new to instant coffee I don't yet appreciate the difference.<br /><br />I do know that the product in these single-serving sticks is the same product that was sold in canisters, before. This is just a new format for their current product, not a new product. And wow, for the sheer pleasure and convenience, it's a decent cup of coffee! It can't be mistaken for richly brewed coffee from a restaurant or from your home coffee machine, not even if you douse it with cream, but instead I compare it to \"office\" coffee, or 'cafe au cube farm', which it definitely matches in taste and quality. Easy, quick, mellow. Great idea when I'm the only soul who wants a cup of coffee and can't bear to brew just one or two lonely cups.<br /><br />The big disadvantage of instant coffee, as far as I'm concerned, is that a serving of this product has only abut 65mg of caffeine compared to 45-180mg of caffeine in a brewed cup of coffee (we're talking in the upper end the way I brew mine!). I want my caffeine! The flavored versions of this product have even less caffeine per serving (at 25-30mg) although I couldn't tell you why. (This information, by the way, comes from the Nescafe website FAQ.) The other disadvantage, I suppose, is that the whole house doesn't fill with the sound and fragrance of brewing coffee when I choose to go instant. Alas.<br /><br />Still, given the convenience and the decency of the beverage itself, I'm now buying these little \"single sticks\" pretty regularly! Recommended. :-)\n",

Yellow dal is a staple of Indian meals (thalis.) Not spicy, but very rich and flavorful. In addition to serving with or over rice, great with bread or toast. Jodhpur is a city in Rajastan, India located southeast of New Delhi. Raja means king. Rajastan is also well known for the high percentage of orthodox Hindu vegetarians living there. Made with lentils, sunflower oil, salt, tomatoes, garlic, cumin, tumeric, and chilis. Easy-open foil pouch. Approx 220 calories, 12g protein, 5g fat per pouch. Labeled vegan on the back of the box. By using only vegetable oils, this wonderful treat also lets Ama Gai [mother cow] save her milk for her own babies. Although freshly and locally made is always better, this Tasty Bite dish is a fantastic tribute to the cuisine of Rajastan and a great choice for everyone to enjoy the wonders of this wonderful Indian cuisine at home.

      "Several years ago, I went on a tour of the Celestial Seasonings tea factory in Boulder, Colorado.  The guide showed us the bales of tea as they arrived, machines that ground and mixed the tea, and a machine that put the tea in tea bags.  The tour included a visit to the room where the peppermint tea was stored.  Our guide told us that peppermint was stored separately so that it would not contaminate the other teas.  He did not tell us what was to come.<br /><br />The doorway into the peppermint room was surrounded by bright red stripes. This should have served as a warning to us.  We all innocently strolled into the peppermint room.  The smell of peppermint was overpowering.  It entered my nose, my head, my lungs, and then my whole being was infused with peppermint.  What a rush!  The crowd stampeded out of the room in a hurry.  For the rest of the day and into the next, all I could smell and taste was the mint.<br /><br />I am now addicted to <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E63L8S\">Celestial Seasonings Peppermint Tea</a>.  Every time I have some, I am reminded of that fateful day in Boulder.  The events of that day have changed my life forever.  Amazingly, the tea is still legal, openly sold in stores and on the Internet.  I think that the tea is great, but then again I am not an unbiased observer.  On your next visit to Boulder, take the tour.  Or go a safer route; buy the tea from Amazon.\n",

      "I've used the European style drip sprouters by Bioset, now called the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000N03EK0\">Victorio VKP1013 Round Three-Tray Kitchen Seed Sprouter</a>, for over ten years, with good results. There was room for improvement, but overall I was content enough with the experience to lead me to expand my sprouting adventure, and now I also grow micro-greens and baby greens in trays. When I decided to take the Bioset on an extended trip and it cracked (silly me), I thought I'd \"upgrade\" to this one, on the advice of one of the various sprouting websites out there, which maligned the Bioset-style sprouters and anyone benighted enough to rely on them. The Sprout Master was billed as the best sprouter in the world, a breeze to use, handy, yadda yadda yadda. The best thing since sliced (sprouted-grain) bread.<br /><br />This was not my experience. I guess it boils down to the fact that the set up is not much different than the drip style, with the exception of increased inconvenience. The Sprout Master requires hand rinsing the seeds and sprouts rather than the pour-and-drip system. This did not bother me in and of itself, however, as I enjoy the process of working with the seeds and sprouts as much as eating them. I was happy to put in more work for better results. Also, with this sprouter, you have to soak your seeds first, which the European style ones get around by taking advantage of the varying surface tension of the water of unsprouted and sprouted seeds. When they are unsprouted, a bit of the water sits in the trays, allowing a mini-soak. Once they sprout, more of the water continues its process from tray to tray to the receptacle. If you are really concerned about too much water sitting there (one of the complaints from the sprouting site), you just give it a few quick shakes, and off goes the water. Here, again, I was unperturbed: I like the process of nurturing my sprouts. Nevertheless, I began to wonder whether the results would be much improved.<br /><br />They weren't. It seems there are operational differences as well as the design distinctions. First, the holes for dripping, which I really did like at first to allow for good clean rinsing, are too large to hold alfalfa, mustard, and similar small seeds, even after soaking overnight. You lose even more as you rinse them for the first day or two. Then, unless you mist the seeds, rinsing tumbles them all around, in addition to pushing some through the holes in the early phase. This means that you don't get nice vertical sprouts unless you are uber-careful. Were that not enough, my first batch just got rotten, moldy, and nasty--something that has never happened to me in over a decade of using the drip sprouters. So I resolved to try again, thinking that maybe I didn't pay attention to placing the lids on properly (necessary in order to allow for air circulation). But first I had to pry sprout roots out of the holes without breaking the the sprouter (the build quality is not encouraging), and to poke out the seeds that had wedged into the holes when small and begun to grow, which I'd also never had to do with the drip sprouters. The second time around I got somewhat better results, but they still did not begin to compare to my standard Bioset crop, even ignoring the extra effort and loss of seeds. Far fewer seeds sprouted (and I'm using the same mix as ever), and they were a knotted mess. I could get equally uninspiring results from a mason jar and cheesecloth.<br /><br />Perhaps this sprouter does well with larger seeds or sprouts that you do not intend to grow vertically. It may be, too, that a little perseverance and a few good new tricks for the smaller seed crops would have made this sprouter useful to me, but I did not see the point. I knew I could do better, and the 30-day deadline for returns was glowering. So I sent it back, and am now trying Victorio's updated drip sprouter, the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005FVPP04\">Victorio VKP1014 4-Tray Kitchen Seed Sprouter</a>, which, though still not ideal, I much prefer to the Sprout Master. The new model is BPA free, made of crack-resistant plastic, does away with the little drain spigots of the previous version (an admitted nuisance), and comes with a lid you can use to store the sprouts in a tray in the fridge. At half the price of the Sprout Master. So far, my first set of sprouts (again, using the same mix) did just dandy, without loss of seeds, mold, rot, tumbled sprouts, marauding roots or seed-clogged holes. Plus it looks oh so pretty with the sprouts all green and alive and vertical in there. (The Sprout Master is opaque, so you can't see the sprouts once they've grown--nor would you necessarily want to, unless you have the patience to pamper your seeds so they grow vertically.)<br /><br />In sum, I really wanted to like this sprouter, and feel like a \"real\" kitchen gardener. But I just didn't. In the end, what sets a real gardener apart is a harvest, not a name brand.\n",

After the heating process, I put the cultured milk in my oven to incubate over about 8 hours (longer than suggested).  Periodically, I'd turn the oven on for a minute or so to get the mixture about 100 degrees F, but I bet the temperature fluxuated quite a bit.<br /><br />I then strained the yogurt through cheesecloth for a few hours (while sitting at room temperature).  The yogurt is far tastier and smoother than Fage brand Greek-style yogurt.  It's about the consistency of very thick mayonaise or sour cream.

      "I used to eat a lot of this when I first \"discovered\" the pleasure of oatmeal about a year ago. Now, I make my own using Quaker's \"Old Fashioned Oats,\" (or Target's cheaper equivalent), which takes only 10 minutes or so, allows me to control the sweetness to my liking by adding the maple syrup and brown sugar myself, and doesn't give me any \"artificial flavors\" or \"guar gum,\" or \"caramel color.\"<br /><br />Given that, I will say that, for an instant product, this is pretty good, though just a bit too sweet for me. Its first ingredient is Whole Grain Rolled Oats (although the second is sugar) and it does have a reasonably creamy consistency which you would expect from oatmeal. I actually preferred Quaker's high fiber variation of this product, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005MWASW6\">Quaker Instant Oatmeal, High Fiber, Maple Brown Sugar, 12.6-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>. I think that one is a little less sweet than this one and the 10 grams of fiber is an attraction if you're trying (like I am) to get more fiber into your diet.<br /><br />It's absurd to compare this to \"old fashioned\" or \"steel cut\" oatmeal. This is a convenience product that requires no preparation and which you would use when you don't have the time or inclination to fuss with the others. It should be evaluated (and consumed) with this in mind.\n",

All I tasted was sugar and bland white rice. I did give it two stars because the bar did have a lot of nuts. Too bad I couldn't taste them. A much tastier option is the Kind brand fruit and nut bars.

      "The following review will incorporate the views of both the taster (in this case me) and the skilled chef (mom naturally!)  This saffron from first appearance and smell can easily be pegged as what we endearingly call \"the good stuff\".  The threads have a nice coarseness to them that are to be expected from top quality saffron.  Upon closer scrutiny we hardly found any hint of \"styles\", or in other words, the wasteful little white things at the end of the stigmas.  While the aroma gives a nice pungent and earthy smell, both my mother and myself still prefer the eau de toilette of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00250QHZU\">Gathering Saffron</a>.<br /><br />Upon preparing a chicken kabob marination with this saffron, we were delighted with the marvellous color developing on the meat.  It was the classic golden hue with little crimson squiggles of the stigma remnants.  As effective a painter as this particular saffron was, my mother did mention to me that the only drawback was the quantity in which it took to get the desired effect.  Therefore its potency may be outperformed by other higher quality saffron brands.<br /><br />Once our banquet was ready to be served and I took the first bite, I was lost in its tangy and tart flavors.  The chicken barely stood up to the pressure of the knife and was incredibly tender in my mouth.  It was near impossible for me to leave any piece of such a delectable plate unfinished.  Though everyone out there may not necessarily get the same exact results, you will be far from disappointed if you purchase this.  So despite the better alternatives out there both my mother and myself recommend this saffron.\n",

      "QUALITY<br />In my opinion, having used a dozen or so brands of olive oil, Colavita is simply the best reasonably priced olive oil which is widely available.  I've been using Colavita for several years now, and have never been dissappointed.  Colavita is excellent quality, dependable, and reasonably priced---the perfect combination for a daily general purpose olive oil.<br /><br />FLAVOR<br />Although not an \"olive oil gourmand\", I'd describe Colavita as \"rich and smooth\".  Connoisseurs probably have other silly terms for the flavor, such as \"nutty\" or \"fruity\" (but a \"civilian\" would never describe the flavor as nutty or fruity). It is not  spicy like Whole Foods 360, and NOT strongly \"olive-oily\" (i.e., \"herby\").  Colavita is an evoo (\"extra virgin olive oil\"---to us non-olive oil snobs), which means \"first pressing\".  Most olive-oil nuts consider the words \"extra virgin\" to be sacred.  Practically speaking though, the mere label \"extra virgin\" is not a guarantee of quality---most grocery store brands (evoo or not) are harsh and bitter, but some are good cooking oils.<br /><br />PREMIUM OILS<br />Botique premium oils are are as variable year to year as wines, comparably expensive, and have to be bought the way you buy fine wine (that is, ideally at tastings, where you confirm the quality and flavor before purchase).  Some are genuinely (as in NOT-gourmet-speak) buttery and nutty---great for dipping.  Some taste like the fragrance of flowers---great for salads.  Never cook premium olive oil---use it for dipping or drizzling, or on delicate salads.  Colavita is a very good general purpose oil, perhaps the best common grocery store olive oil, but is not quite a premium oil.<br /><br />Although heresy (comparable to suggesting fruit wines to a wine connoisseur) there are inexpensive alternatives to premium botique olive oils, including pumpkinseed, almond, sesame, and walnut oil.  I particularly love pumpkinseed oil as a dipping oil (by itself, no vinegar, and with a little salt). The following are examples---I can't vouch for the specific brands as they are different from what I use.  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000B5OCFS\">Styrian Pumpkinseed Oil 8.45 oz</a>, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JV3C82\">Pure Almond Oil 300ml</a>, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002YB21A\">Kadoya - Pure Sesame Oil 5.5 Oz.</a>, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017O8F0A\">100% Natural Walnut Oil, Cold Pressed 16 fl oz (474 ml) Liquid</a><br /><br />COOKING OIL<br />Non-extra virgin olive oils (second or later pressings) are usually darker and stronger flavored---which adds depth and complexity to soups, sauses, stews, chili, casseroles, bean dishes etc. I add 1/4 to 1/2 cup of olive oil to such dishes.  Unless you particularly want the dish to taste \"olive-oily\" (I never do), cook the oil WITH the dish.  However, olive oil can \"go bad\"---so unless you use alot, it doesn't sense to use a different cooking oil than you use on salads, for dipping etc.  Colavita is a very good general purpose oil, and therefore a good cooking oil.<br /><br />\"Cooking\" does NOT mean \"frying\" with ANY olive oil.  Because of the low smoke point (i.e., olive oil burns at a low temperature) olive oil is NOT suitable for frying.  That said, you can carefully fry an egg in olive oil at a low temperature (and honestly, good fried eggs swimming in good olive oil are wonderful).  But you can NOT fry meat nor deep-fry anything.  The best frying oil is peanut oil.  Canola is a good frying oil and is particularly healthy.  Like olive oil there is variation in the brands.  Peanut oil should be slightly nutty, but not peanutty.  Canola oil should be flavorless.<br /><br />DIPPING OIL<br />Traditionally (and in the best restaurants), Italian bread, oil and balsamic vinegar is served as an appetizer.  The diner usually mixes his own oil and vinegar at the table.  Albeit probably heresy, you can subsitute other premium types of vinegar (such as wine vinegar, rasberry vinegar, or even apple vinegar) or fresh lemon juice.  I usually add a few drops soy sause or Braggs for saltiness and richness to the mixture. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ4Y4W\">Bragg Liquid Aminos, Natural Soy Sauce Alternative, 32-Ounce Bottle , (Pack of 3)</a> Colavita is a very good \"everyday\" dipping oil.<br /><br />SALAD OIL<br />The requirements for an \"everyday\" salad oil are a little less stringent than that for a dipping oil, because the heavy flavor of the vinegar, and often pamessan, bacon bits, etc. usually dominate.  However, I rarely use oil and vinegar the traditional way.  For everyday salads (or as a dip for raw vegies) I prefer olive-oil based mayo with a little freshly ground pepper, and some citrus zest.  For special salads, I use a seed or nut oil or a fruity premium olive oil (and just a hint of lemon and/or orange juice and zest).  Colavita is a very good \"everyday\" salad oil.  If you are not familiar with fresh citrus zest (wonderful stuff), the tool to use is <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004S7V8\">Microplane 40020 Classic Zester/Grater</a><br /><br />DRIZZING OIL<br />A drizzling oil is an oil you pour over a dish immediately before serving, or which you serve in a carafe on the table.  If you REALLY like the flavor of \"ordinary good\" olive oil (I don't)---then you will find Colavita to be a good drizzling oil.  My hispanic wife frequently drizzles Colavita on the dishes I've cooked (with Colavita), because she likes the olive-oil flavor.  By the way, the same principle applies to the use of butter, pepper, garlic, cheese, even soy sause---if you want the flavor to dominate, add it just before serving; if you want the flavor to be subtle, cook the seasoning with the dish.  For most dishes I prefer a rich blend of subtle flavors.<br /><br />HEALTHY COOKING<br />I go to a great deal of effort to minimize animal fat in my diet, by very strict trimming, thorough cooking, and by chilling broth to remove the solidified fat.  However, the body needs fat and craves fat.  The ideal solution is to replace animal fat with healthy vegetable oils.  Olive oil is ideal for the purpose.  Canola is better, but is essentially flavorless.<br /><br />My Southern grandmother could not cook any vegetables without a thick slice of fatback (fatty bacon)---and indeed her vegetables were very tasty.  Speaking of which, what is the point of healthy vegetables if no-one will eat them?  The solution is to add several tablespoon fulls of olive oil, and just a teaspoon of chipped ham <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NERTSE\">Hormel Premium Real Crumbled Bacon</a> to the vegies.  For the best flavor, cook the vegies with the olive oil (do NOT add oil to the cooked vegetables---unless you really like the flavor of the oil).  Season as necessary with pepper and fresh lemon juice.  Truly delicious vegetables are possible---I eat them daily.<br /><br />ECONOMY<br />It has been about a year since I've purchased Colavita because I can buy a better but obscure brand (Bella Famiglia) locally for $12 per 17oz bottle.  The 34 ounce tins of Colavita <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELLB16\">Colavita Extra Virgin Olive Oil, 34-Ounce Tins (Pack of 2)</a> are about half the price of the bottle per oz at this time, but is still expensive for the quality, particularly with the shipping charge.  The tins are small enough to use directly. But I prefer bottles, because controlling the flow of the oil is easier (since you can see the oil approaching the spout), and it is easier to gauge the amount of oil I'm using by eye (how far the level drops in the glass bottle). So, I refill bottles from the tins.  I've been told that olive oil stays fresher in tins (measured in months and years) That becomes relevant when you don't know how many months (or even years) a bottle may have sat on a grocery shelf.<br /><br />GENERAL RECCOMENDATION<br />The price of many items, including Colavita vary wildly on Amazon, sometimes from day-to-day.  Sometimes it is available directly from Amazon with free shipping, sometimes not---which makes a big difference in the total coat.  After major grocery shopping expeditions, sit down at your computer with your reciept, and check if you can buy any of the non-perishables through Amazon. When you find items (even if more expensive than you just paid), put the item on your Amazon wish list, and add a note to the wish list of the price you just paid. Check your wish list frequently, and when you see an item you need at a bargain price, buy it.\n",

They are only about 10 dollars more than the 4 oz packs, but you get twice as much product!<br />As far as taste, the oil and salt gives a spectacular taste to the popped corn. It isn't exactly that movie theater taste, but it is darn close. I mean lets be realistic, copying that theater taste is hard. But nevertheless, the taste is wonderful. I only use about 1/2-3/4 of the flavored salt because I think using all of it makes the popcorn too salty for me. The quality of the kernels is excellent. They pop quite big and aren't too chewy. If anyone has used cheap kernels (like great value), you know it can ruin popcorn.<br />I use the packs for my <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004SU35\">Wabash Valley Farms 25008 Whirley-Pop Stovetop Popcorn Popper</a>, so I have to divide the contents in half.

I eat popcorn frequently, so it doesn't stay in the ziploc long, a few days at most.

The other reviews all state that the popcorn once popped is really salty. I did not have this experience and quite on the contrary found it to be not salty at all.  This might be due to the difference in popping machines.  In the stir crazy when I poured the popcorn/salt side into the machine the salt all fell into a pile.  The stirring arm on the machine probably wasn't able to move the salt around like in a kettle type machine.  I also feel that the package does not include enough of the oil to make the popcorn really flavorful.  There was plenty to pop and flavor it but I think I just prefer more oil in my popcorn.  Lastly, the kernels while tasting pretty good did not pop as big as Orville Reddenbacher.  They weren't as fluffy and were more dense as well.  On the plus size they did not have a lot of husks to get stuck in your teeth like the \"Gold Medal\" brand I've tried recently.  Overall a pretty good product to use in the Stir Crazy.  When I get a kettle type machine in the near future I will definitely be trying these packs again to see if there is a difference in the taste based on the type of machine.\n",

When I first ventured into popping my own, I bought a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004RC6R\">West Bend 82306 Stir Crazy 6-Quart Electric Popcorn Popper</a>. I then went to the store and bought some popcorn oil and some kernels. I was so disappointed when I had it.<br /><br />Then a friend recommended this popcorn to me, and I absolutely love it. I've bought two boxes so far from Amazon. It tastes as close to anything I've ever had to movie popcorn (minus the butter).<br /><br />A few suggestions if you use this with the Stir Crazy.<br /><br />- If you use a Stir Crazy, the 4 oz. packs will fill it up perfectly.<br />- Separate kernels on both sides of the rod in the middle, and distribute the oil in 2 portions on either side also.<br />- Enjoy!<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />+ All ingredients in 1 pack.<br /><br />+ Tastes incredible.<br /><br />+ You can use as much or as little butter salt as you want.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />- Coconut oil is a bit sticky when you squeeze it out of the pack.<br /><br />Overall, highly recommended.\n",

      "Like others have said, this stuff tastes great.  What I could find out is if it popped well in a microwave bowl like my <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002BBAHV8\">Fireworks Popcorn Microwave Popping Bowl and Gift Set,  Gift Box</a>.<br /><br />I emailed Great Northern Customer Service a couple times with that question and a request for a sample if the didn't know so I could try it.  They never responded and I took a chance and ordered some.<br /><br />This time taking a chance paid off.  It pops great and tastes great too.<br /><br />My only issue is the 4-ounce pack overflows my popcorn popping bowl.  My next order will be for their 2.5 oz packs.<br /><br />Bottom line: regardless of the size, this stuff tastes tons better than any other popcorn I've tried and works great in a microwave popping bowl.\n",

Extra virgin olive oil is much tastier for salads or simple recipes than the light olive oil.<br /><br />Of course you have to make sure you are getting the proper oil for your needs and recipes.  Sometimes the light olive oil is called for by certain recipes.  Some people also need to use *light* for health reasons. Olive oil is generally considered to be healthy so those people should be the exception.<br /><br />The other thing to keep in mind is the price.  This is one of those products where it really pays to subscribe.  It's on the expensive side anyway, but subscribing makes it more bearable.<br /><br />You can never have too much high quality olive oil when you love to cook.  This stuff gets used quickly.

      "A kind friend bought a six pack of these for us to try out. My pre teen has Celiac and our kitchen is GF and we are always willing to try out different GF items. Our current bread standby is from Glutino and, while it is not perfect, my kids enjoy it - especially when used to make french toast!<br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EVG8H4\">The Gluten-Free Pantry Favorite Sandwich Bread Mix, 22-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a><br /><br />The first four packs I made I followed to the letter. I was a little disappointed that the instructions on the back for using the bread mix for oven baked bread, bagels, pizza dough, cinnamon bread and egg free bread all stated in large bold lettering that it required the use of a heavy duty stand mixer. I don't have one and so those options were out for me.  But still, using the recipe for breadmakers turned out decent (if fairly flat) loaves. I made the basic recipe and the sweet bread. The instructions state that you should make this on a Basic White bread setting instead of the Gluten free setting on your breadmaker and that is what I did.<br /><br />(Note that if you are buying this mix to bake in your oven, the package states that you need to use a stand mixer!)<br /><br />My child said that the bread was okay but that it had a wierd texture and taste to it. I think the texture was due to the grainy nature of the 3 rice flours in the mix. The flavor, I think, is the Millet flour which tends to have a bitter aftertaste. Millet does have good nutritional value but if the flavor turns off the child from eating it what is the point??<br /><br />Anyway, I still had two packs to go so I decided to tweak things a little. I made the sweet bread recipe again but this time I used butter instead of oil and baked it in my Zojirushi breadmaker on a programmed gluten free program and Voila! The bread rose beautifully! It had a light airy feel to it; a bit spongy - almost like a cake. The 1/4 cup sugar covered up the bitterness of the millet, home made butter (could use unsalted) instead of the melted oil made it rich - and it tastes almost exactly like Challah bread!<br /><br />So if you are just GF and not CF as well, this is a sure fire way to make some excellent sweet egg bread.  And if, like us, you miss your Shabbat Challah, this bread mix will be a wonderful addition to your kitchen!\n",

      "<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DZFMEQ\">Pamela's Products Wheat-Free & Gluten-Free, Amazing  Bread Mix, 19-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6)</a> I buy (and need) a variety of gluten-free grocery products--mostly in the baking category.  I've been fortunate to find the desired items in my local shopping area, but that effort is tarnished with too much time, travel, and occasional disappointment with product availability. Amazon came to the rescue with quite a few gluten-free cooking and bakery items advertised on their web pages. Now I've come to depend on several of my favorites, most importantly Pamela's Wheat-Free & Gluten-Free Amazing Bread Mix. I love it, and I say that while speaking from the experience of being on a gluten-free diet for over nine years. I've been baking bread at home all that time, using various recipes having around a dozen ingredients. The results with a few of those chosen recipes have been quite good, certainly a far cry from the comparable  products in the stores. For some time now I've baked with the bread mixes offered by several out-of-state companies. The results--passable but nothing to rave about. Then I discovered Pamela's products in local stores and couldn't believe the high quality, great taste and density (2+ pounds per loaf) of the amazing gluten-free bread mix (just four ingredients plus the mix to bake it).  Now I opt for that continually and the big surprise came when I saw that Amazon.com carried it on their Web site. More satisfaction developed over the fact that Amazon delivered a six-bag box in just a few days and with a  very satisfactory and competitive price that changed me from a struggling on-the-road shopper to a stay-at-home baker. Thank you Amazon--for the bread mix, cookies and oatmeal, all gluten-free.\n",

It works just fine using my Kitchen Aid mixer and my oven, I didn't need a bread machine.<br /><br />The suggestion on the package to add 2 TBSP molasses for a whole wheat bread taste makes a good GF bread great.  Also, I've continued using a tip I picked up somewhere to substitute 1/4 cup of ground flaxseed + 1/4 cup water for 2 eggs (more fiber, less fat).

      "Purchased approximately 24 of these bars in different flavors (the chocolate fudge being my personal favorite, though the brownie crunch is also tasty).  The texture is a bit chewy but the flavor is good...for a protein bar.  Not necessarily on par with the average sugar-filled candy bar of course.  The carb/sugar/protein content is on par with most higher end Gluten Free protein bars I've discovered (including Quest Bars and NoGii).<br /><br />All things considered - flavor, consistency, and quality, I'd likely give these 4 stars.  The issue, however, is that after eating about 6 bars with no issues, I began having gluten reactions to the next three I attempted to eat.  Needless to say, no matter how much protein you consume, your workouts are not going to go well if you're horribly sick.<br /><br />I have written to the company to complain, but cannot afford to take this risk, especially with other comparable bars available.  I caution anyone with Celiac Disease to try these at your own risk, they say GLUTEN FREE on the label, but something was not or a batch became contaminated.  I've been a diagnosed Celiac for over 10 years and I (unfortunately) know the reaction all too well and this bar sparked it.<br /><br />Although I wanted to support this bar for it's high protein content and GF label, I will not buy Think Thin bars again for this reason.  I've moved to Quest Protein Bars for now as I've never had any gluten or allergic reactions to those (and they tend to taste better if you like an almond/caramel type flavor) <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00418OR56\">Quest Bar 2.12 oz.

      "BOTTOM LINE:<br />GLUTEN FREE!  This stuff was sooo good, I really wish I had another bowl right now. The Quantity:Price ratio takes the product down one star.<br /><br />FLAVOR:<br />I thought the flavor was excellent, in that I could really taste the garlic, pepper, and onions.  The broth was a little salty at first, but I added a bit more water to get it to where I wanted.  I also thought it could use a little spiciness, but I feel that way about everything (I left out their oil packet and added a squirt of my own Hot Chili Sesame Oil - <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0005ZXXWM\">House of Tsang Hot Chili Sesame Oil</a> and it was perfect).  It was really nice in that it had more than just your standard chicken/ msg broth flavor - it had real subtle flavor notes.<br /><br />NOODLES:<br />GLUTEN FREE!  I thought I would note that I really like the noodles in this - they are not your standard Ramen noodle, but are a form of rice noodle, similar to Vietnamese Pho.  These take a little longer to cook, but are definitely a great match for the broth.  I bought them because they are gluten free, but they make a great soup noodle in their own right.<br /><br />QUANTITY vs. PRICE:<br />I wish there was more in the bowl than what was provided.  This is what takes the product from 5 stars down to 4.  For the price, I wish there was more food - or for the amount of food, I wish it was cheaper.  To be fair, I bought this at my supermarket, and not on here, but the price is similar.\n",

My 40lbs Aussie who is a moderate chewer, is about the large ball's limit and once she pops the treat out, the remainder is gone in less than 5 minutes. If you have a tiny dog, get the right size. They aren't going to be able to handle the large. They need to be able to gnaw at it, which they won't be able to do on the larger balls.<br /><br />Third: These are pretty neutral smelling, which is a plus for this line. I know dogs are all about the smell of things and the stinkier something is, the more they like them...but when you have to share the household with a dog, you need to find a happy medium. This is ours when company comes over. It has no real smell, but they aren't her favorite either.\n",

I used one scoop and a battery operated mixer which gave it a lovely froth.  This is a wonderful product, especially on a chilly night.  Exceptional value purchasing 2 cans.

I tried the Newman's gluten free version last year when I became Vegan.  Surprise!  These are Vegan friendly as well, not to mention organic if you care about such things.

It will make many yummy things that would not have been made had it not been for this item at Amazon.com.<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HDI5O8\">Farmer's Market Foods Organic Canned Pumpkin, 15-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>\n",

      "I've been using Farmer's Market Organic Canned Pumpkin for a couple of years now.  During the great pumpkin shortage of 2009, Amazon seemed to be the only place that I could find canned pumpkin and so I decided to take a chance.  It is perfect!  It is creamy and smooth with no additives.  When it became available for Subscribe and Save, I jumped at the chance.  Buying it locally was a bit cost restrictive at about $3 a can.<br /><br />What do I use so much pumpkin for?  I first learned the wonders of pumpkin from Hungry Girl's daily newsletter.  (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312377428\">Hungry Girl: Recipes and Survival Strategies for Guilt-Free Eating in the Real World</a>).  Sugar Free Devils Food Cake mix and a can of pumpkin = fudgy brownies.<br /><br />Then I inherited a cat with, ahem, problems.  Poor little thing.  While refreshing my pet care knowledge, I read about folks using canned pumpkin for their dogs.  What the heck.  Gave it a try and it seems to help.  BUT!! now she won't eat her meals without it.  She's hooked on pumpkin--a pumpkin junkie.  Thankfully, with Farmer's Market Organic, I can rest assured that, like her cat food, there are no harmful additives.<br /><br />Sadly, I've been unable to get the pumpkin from Amazon of late.  I even resorted to that other named brand and the difference is startling:  stringy and off colored.<br /><br />Fortunately, Farmer's Market Organic pumpkin is available in my local stores once again, however I am going to miss the Subscribe & Save option.\n",

It happened to me when I was a kid and it's not fun (severe stomach pain & everything else you can imagine). You can even croak from it. Amazon does a terrific job. I buy all my groceries from them, so please, blame the seller, don't blame a good company that always attempts to do their best.  I'm giving this product five stars because the pumpkin is excellent; have been buying it for years at a local gourmet & organic store.  Now I'm buying it from Amazon.\n",

      "First thing's first: The taste. It tastes sort of like generic cough syrup, minus the medicine-like taste (if that makes sense). It doesn't taste like any other energy drink I've ever had before. So it's unique in that regard. It's not necessarily a good thing, though. I would have to say that as far as taste goes, I would not recommend it.<br /><br />Secondly, the \"spicy, burn your throat\" gimmick. It's just that, a gimmick. It doesn't taste spicy so much as it just makes your throat itch. I assume that the slight \"spicy\" feeling comes from the drink being cold, but if drank warm I'd assume it would taste like camel urine. All it really did was kind of annoy me, it didn't really add to the experience. Not that I was looking for the real cocaine experience. *wink wink*<br /><br />Thirdly, while it has a high amount of caffeine, it didn't give me quite the kick I was expecting. It woke me up a little, but it didn't do much else. But then again, I drink energy drinks like water so I have a high tolerance. Though I would not recommend it to others, if you value your health.<br /><br />My girlfriend said that the caffeine effected her more than it did me. She got more of an energy boost without the jittery feeling you may get with supplements such as 5-Hour Energy. She said that she enjoyed the flavor of the drink, so you have a second opinion there. She said that she had experienced the taste combination of cinnamon and strawberry. She enjoyed the \"spicy\"-ness of it but agrees that it wasn't as strong as expected. Even though she liked it, she would only be interested in buying this again if more cans were added or the price was lowered.<br /><br />Now, here's where I would have to suggest not buying this product. Whether I liked it or not. It is TOO. *BLEEP*ING. EXPENSIVE. About $30 (including shipping) for six 8.4 fl oz (250ml) cans. You're better off buying something like the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004NCTXZY\">Power Horse BIG 16 Energy Drink, 16-Ounce (Pack of 24)</a>. It costs about the same, maybe a couple bucks more, and you get 24 16 fl oz cans. And in my opinion, it gives you more of a boost, tastes better, and you get more for your money. It's a cheap alternative to the more well-known energy drinks (i.e. Red Bull, Rockstar, Monster, etc.).<br /><br />All in all, mediocre experience, mediocre drink, too costly. NOT. WORTH. IT. Save your money. Don't fall for the hype like we did.\n",

      "This is a good quality syrup and my least favorite of the 3 I've tried.  It is very sweet when compared with the other 2 that I've tried.  I typically don't like things very sweet.  If you like sweetness, this one is for you.  This may be a good syrup to use if you want to put in less syrup in your Master Cleanse lemonades in order to cut calories.  I used 3 syrups listed below for my Master Cleanse.  They are all good quality and I'd recommend any of them.  You probably will want 1 jug for every 5 days of a cleanse.

Here's my brief breakdown:<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00271OPVU\">Coombs Family Farms 100% Pure Organic Maple Syrup Grade B, 32-Ounce Jug</a> - The sweetest of the 3 for sure.

When I put this in my lemonade for the Master Cleanse, it makes the lemonade sweeter than how I like it.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ENHSC8\">NOW Foods Maple Syrup Grade B Organic, 32 ounce</a> - Is less sweet when compared to Coombs but a little sweeter than Family Heritage.  Runnier than Coombs but these syrups are all a little runnier than grocery syrups.  200 calories per serving of 4 tbsp.  It provided the right amount of sweetness for the Master Cleanse specifications for a drink.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00248E980\">Family Heritage Organic Vermont Maple Syrup, Grade B, 32-Ounce Jug</a> - Good quality and tastes sweet but definitely not as sweet as the other 2.  Didn't get the calorie info before throwing the bottle away but I'm figuring it's the same as the other 2.  I usually put an extra 1/2 a tbsp in my master cleanse lemonade to get it a little sweeter and curb the hunger.\n",

      "I am also trying out hibiscus tea because I have read that there are clinical trials that show hibiscus lowers blood pressure. I'm not sure how strong hibiscus tea is \"supposed\" to be, but about 10 petals in a coffee mug works for me. The tea produced is very strong and exceptionally sour which, personally, I love. I would say it's similar in taste to rhubarb which I also love. You can add a sugar or sugar alternative if you want, but I say it tastes great straight.<br /><br />I was expecting this to be a finely chopped powder, but as others have said, these are full petals (see my user added image). You don't really need to buy a tea strainer for this. I use a bombilla sometimes,<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00141O2IA\">Stainless Steel Spring Bombilla 1 Count</a>, but really, it isn't necessary. Which is convenient for those of us who get lazy. Put petals in coffee mug, pour in water, microwave for 1:30, voila! Just throw away or eat petals when finished. (They have a nice texture to them after they've steeped for a few minutes).<br /><br />Other notes: the tea produced is a very deep and pretty magenta. If it spills on something white, like for example my shirt, it turns into an indigo stain. Would probably be good for and all-natural tie-dye.<br /><br />From Wikipedia:<br />\"A study published in the Journal of Human Hypertension has shown that drinking hibiscus tea can reduce high blood pressure in people with type 2 diabetes. The study results showed the average systolic blood pressure for those drinking hibiscus tea decreased from 134.8 mmHg (17.97 kPa) at the beginning of the study to 112.7 mmHg (15.03 kPa) at the end of the study, one month later.[5] This is consistent with its supposed role as a diuretic.\"\n",

This is a little funny, because Carte Noire is a supermarket brand in France. (Kraft markets both Starbucks and Carte Noire in grocery channels, and they developed the Tassimo system.) To my taste, it's full-flavored without being overly bitter.<br /><br />This Carte Noire Kenya is one of my favorites. It's in between the espresso discs and Starbucks coffee discs. It is bolder/darker and more intense than the strong coffees like <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002WDCAJ2\">Starbucks Verona</a> or <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002WD93EW\">Starbucks Kitamu</a>; but less bitter than straight espresso. The volume produced is in between as well--it underfills a coffee cup, but overflows an espresso cup. Finally, the Kenya is programmed in the Tassimo to add the \"crema,\" the dark foam on top of an espresso, on a short cup of coffee.<br /><br />If you have Tassimo, and if you like the darker Starbucks blends on it, and you want to check out one of the European brands--this is the one to try.\n",

I am of the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143114964\">Michael Pollan</a> camp that says if you want to eat something unhealthy, then make it yourself.  It will taste better, and be packed with actual ingredients instead of chemical filler.<br /><br />And yes, these \"Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Chocolate Almond\" are unhealthy, no matter that they are qualified with \"a wholesome way to satisfy your sweet tooth.\"  There may be 10 grams of whole grains per serving, but look closely at that ingredients list and you will find a whole bunch of things that mother nature never intended to be used as food.  Each cookie carries a pretty hefty calorie count as well, so this isn't a carefree snack.<br /><br />They taste ... OK.  They have that same chemical aftertaste of most packaged cookies, and for a soft cookie they are somewhat dry and flavorless.  There are chocolate chunks and almonds,  which is a nice addition, but doesn't make up for the chemical flavor and dryness.<br /><br />For me, I will just stick with homemade.  Oatmeal cookies are easy and fun to make, and taste 100% better than these packaged ones.  Quaker Oats has some good ideas, and I think I will toss some almonds and real chocolate chips into my next batch of cookies, but I won't be buying these again.\n",

That's coming from a guy closing on 50; this probably would be the perspective of a younger demographic.<br /><br />When it comes to soft cookies, all are measured by the inimitable standard of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00512RI1Q\">Archway</a>.  Is it as good as an <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006R0AG4W\">Archway</a> soft cookie?  Well, this product is not.  Sorry.  But, this is not to say this is a bad cookie.<br /><br />Each cookie is individually packaged, six to a box.  The cookie measures just short of 3.5\" across (that's a nice round 90mm for our international friends).  Thankfully, there is none of that really artificial, factory smell of preservatives and softeners that you can get with many soft cookies.  That is a big plus for this product.<br /><br />My experience with six of these cookies is that there's an awful lot of oatmeal, and not really that much chocolate or almonds.  The dark blotches of chocolate and the whitish blotches of almond pieces are visible enough on/in the cookie, top or bottom (not like the photos on the package, naturally), but neither really comes through in either mouth texture or taste.<br /><br />I also found these to be somewhat dry.  A couple of the cookies had started to break/fracture right out of the packaging, and this may have been a function of how dry they were.  They are soft cookies, well, soft enough, but they don't have that resistance to pulling them apart, none of that sexy pull-apart squishiness you get in the TV commercials.<br /><br />Although the box tells you that this is a good source of fiber (true) and that you're getting wonderful <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002UT5H3E\">Quaker whole-grain oats</a>, this is not a sugar-free or otherwise clearly good-for-you product.  It's sugar and chocolate, at 180 calories and 70g of fat per cookie, more than 1,000 calories in the box.  This product is not about diet or longevity--it is about indulgence.  And guilt.<br /><br />Bottom line: would I eat a box of these to save the rain forest?  Sure.  Would I encourage an unattractively thin model to eat one?  Yes.  Would I feed them to my family?  Yes.  Would I eat one instead of an Archway apple-filled oatmeal?  Sorry, no way.  Soft-cookie technology has advanced by leaps and bounds in our lifetime, a testament to the thousands of dedicated and bespectacled men and women working in the deeply buried top-secret cookie development bunkers around the world, but they need to stay down there and keep working a little harder.

As for the underwhelming taste, I turned to another resource: my sons (ages 9 and 8) are excellent food critics, albeit not the most discerning ones. I need only leave a plate of food within arm's reach while they play board games, their Xbox 360 or watch a movie. Snacks like watermelon, popcorn or licorice, disappear quickly.<br /><br />However, both boys passed on the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie opened for the video review. That sums it up for me.<br /><br />Rating: One star.<br /><br />Do you need to satisfy a sweet tooth? I recommend <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005BPVB9S\">Eat. Think. Smile.

      "As a self-professed cookie connoisseur, I was excited to try out Quaker's new oatmeal cookies. Unfortunately I cannot express my disappointment enough. While they may not be hands-down the worst cookies ever, they are far from even being mediocre and taste nothing like any oatmeal cookies I've ever eaten. They're a very dry and gritty cookie (I'm talking sawdust dry grit here) that taste of preservatives and, oddly enough, sugary blandness. If cardboard was more crumbly, I imagine it'd taste about the same with sugar and preservatives added. The chocolate and almonds may have an alright flavor, but what little is added isn't enough to salvage these cookies and the rest of the cookie overwhelms the taste of those two ingredients with its grit and dryness. After eating one cookie, I had absolutely no desire to have another one. Ever. Purporting to be a \"healthy\" cookie (relatively speaking, they are cookies after all), they do have four grams of fiber and three grams of protein, but at 180 calories with two grams of saturated fat, there are much better alternatives out there. Say, ones that actually taste good. And I haven't even touched upon the mega list of ingredients in these suckers, which is long, way longer than any \"healthy\" cookie should have. While the packaging has the proclamation that these are \"Naturally Flavored\", they also fail to mention there are artificial flavors included as well. You can be assured I'll not be getting these again and will be cautious about other Quaker products, those that venture beyond regular oatmeal that is, from now on. While each of the six cookies is individually wrapped to easily grab-and-go, it's almost as easy to take any cookie and put it in a baggie or container. I don't recommend <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JFMH96\">Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Chocolate Almond, 8.8-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a> unless you just cannot pass them up and they're on sale at a super low price, otherwise you won't miss a thing.<br /><br />P.S. Drowning them in (soy)milk doesn't help the taste either. Perhaps just drowning them in the toilet would be for the best.\n",

      "My Shetland Sheepdog, Baird, has some dirty teeth. He's also... weird... for a dog. He doesn't chew on ANYTHING really. I mean, as a puppy he chewed the wall once, but we sprayed that with some of that nasty tasting spray stuff and since then, no problem.<br /><br />He used to love to chew on cow hooves, but for some reason he just seems to enjoy licking them now (maybe he likes the pasture flavorings). He doesn't chew any of his chew toys.<br /><br />So how do you clean a dog's teeth if they don't chew on anything? The answer is brushing (which is always good regardless of whether your dog chews or not!) and not much else.<br /><br />While at the vet I saw the CET Enzymatic HEXTRA Premium chews. $30 a bag for 30 chews. It seemed excessive, but to keep from having to put Baird through the scary procedure of a full teeth cleaning, it seems a small price to pay. My fear was he wouldn't chew on them. Turns out... he LOVES them!<br /><br />The thing is, the $30 price tag really got me, so I decided to try to find something a little cheaper, when I happened upon Amazon and found the \"one step down from top of the line\" Virbac (makers of the CET chews), \"C.E.T. Enzymatic Oral Hygiene Chews for Large Dogs, 30 Chews.\" It's not completely clear what the exact differences between these and the HEXTRA Premiums, but the chews do smell different (I think this has to do with the chicken flavoring on these which the Premiums don't have).<br /><br />And it turns out Baird loves these as well.<br /><br />One thing to remember is that if your dog has yellowed teeth, simple chews won't fix that. All you can do is get those teeth deep cleaned... however, this is just generally surface staining, so brushing and providing chews like these will actually clear the plaque. And the plaque is the part you are worried about, given that's what can cause health problems with your dogs.<br /><br />Over all, I'm happy that Baird's happy with these chews. If you can't brush your dog's teeth all the time, these make an OK alternative to brushing. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001P05K7W\">C.E.T. HEXtra Premium Oral Hygiene Chews with Chlorhexidine, Large Dogs, 30 Chews</a> are available as well, they are just a few dollars more.

About 20 species of pine produce seeds large enough to be worth harvesting; in other pines the seeds are also edible, but are too small to be of great value as a human food. The Woodstock Farms organic Pine Nuts are some of the best I have used and eaten. I always saute then in either olive oil or butter, then mix them in recipes or with rice and couscous. They give a delectable flavor, and add a great deal to any food.<br /><br />''Pine nuts have been eaten in Europe and Asia since the Paleolithic period. They are frequently added to meat, fish, salads and vegetable dishes or baked into bread. In Italian they are called pinoli (in the U.S. they are often called \"pignoli\" but in Italy \"pignolo\" is actually a word far more commonly used to describe a fussy, overly fastidious or extremely meticulous person)[10] and are an essential component of Italian pesto sauce. Pignoli cookies, an Italian American specialty confection (in Italy these would be called \"biscotti ai pinoli\"), are made of almond flour formed into a dough similar to that of a macaroon and then topped with pine nuts. In Spain, a sweet is made of small marzipan balls covered with pine nuts, painted with egg and lightly cooked. Pine nuts are also featured in the salade landaise of southwestern France. Pine nut coffee, known as pi&ntilde;&oacute;n (Spanish for pine nut), is a speciality found in the southwest United States, especially New Mexico, and is typically a dark roast coffee having a deep, nutty flavour; roasted and lightly salted pine nuts can often be found sold on the side of the road in cities across New Mexico to be used for this purpose, as well as a snack. The Nevada, or Great Basin, pine nut has a sweet fruity flavor and is relished for its large size, sweet flavor and ease of peeling.\" Wikipedia<br /><br />Pine nuts are a necessity in my kitchen, and the Woodstock brand is the best I have had.<br /><br />Highly Recommended. prisrob 03-12-12<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HN5O46\">Woodstock Farms Thompson Raisins, Organic, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)</a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0046HLQ2O\">Woodstock Farms Raw Almond Butter -- 16 oz Each</a>\n",

I'm attached to the taste, which carries the familiar acidic \"bite\" of black tea, but balances it with the alkaline health effects of green tea.

Now, however, I can say to anyone considering it, that if you like Earl Grey tea, then you'll love this version!<br /><br />For me, the flavor is best when the tea is piping hot (and less enjoyable if allowed to cool).  Consequently, I tend to brew it in an insulated stainless steel mug, which is then topped by a silicone cup lid (similar to the one at this link).

I have drank both this straight green tea and the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQIDK6\">Stash Premium Organic Earl Grey Black and Green Tea</a> combination.

I find that too many American-produced green teas are \"watered down\" in flavor, lacking the oomph that one finds in a true Japanese or Chinese green tea.  This cup, however, is close to the real thing. It also gives off a nice green color, which is always a good sign.<br /><br />By no means the best tea you will ever drink, but this Premium Green Tea might just possibly the best inexpensive tea-bag style green tea on the market.\n",

I don't know who the supplier is but this is a complete rip.  Buyer beware!  Amazon - take this off your site!  I am not happy.\n",

      "This brand of chips has been my favorite since I found them down in Pennsylvania when I used to travel that way.  A few years ago they started to sell them in New England and I was thrilled!  I've been buying them weekly since they made there appearance.<br /><br />But now I found I have entered those years were I have to watch my salt intake and the first thing to go was my beloved chips.  I have been depressed.  UNTIL I found quit by accident via Amazon that Herr's makes a lower salt chip.  And it is delicious.  I have been buying  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0052Y7YL2\">Lay's Lightly Salted Potato Chips 10 oz</a> and while they are good, they are not GREAT like Herr's.  The Lay's taste and appearance can be inconsistent, you may find overly greasy chips one day and  unsalted ones the next.  And you never find those good slightly browned ones.<br /><br /> Herr's is consistently tasty, has some browner ones mixed in and you may even find some with skin on the edge of the chips. They are truly delicious and to be able to get them from the comfort of my home while still in my PJ's isd a treat.  And these chips are a treat I can't pass up.\n",

      "I have been drinking Twinings teas for years.  Twinings teas are consistently good.  Each tea bag comes in a sealed envelope which helps to keep it fresh.  Over a period of time, I have settled on two favorites.  These are the Darjeeling and Green teas.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4F95C\">Twinings Darjeeling Tea</a>: At one time, I used Twinings China Black Tea.  Unfortunately, they stopped selling that variety.  I tried others, but chose the Darjeeling tea for an afternoon tea and snack break.  It offers a nice strong flavor and deep color.  There is enough caffeine in this tea to provide a nice lift.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4DKAS\">Twinings Green Tea</a>:  There are quite a few varieties of green tea offered by Twinings. I prefer the pure green tea.  Interestingly, according to the product blurb, green tea is made from the same leaves as is black tea.  The difference is in the processing.  Green tea is lighter in color and has a more subtle taste.  In general, green teas have less caffeine than the darker teas.  I find that the Green tea is good for early evening.  It has just enough caffeine to provide some energy but not too much to keep me awake at night.<br /><br />I recommend both the Darjeeling and Green varieties of Twinings teas.\n",

      "****Latest Update****<br /><br />We are now past the baby food stage so I may have missed this if it was formally announced, but I recently heard that they switched packaging in late 2011 to be completely BPA free.  I confirmed this with customer service.  Leaving the remaining review as it was...<br /><br />*********************<br /><br />My wife had made her own baby food for our daughter for the first eight months. Then, when our daughter was going to begin daycare, there was a certain convenience factor of being about to send in jars of baby food for her and so we bought Earth's Best. It was organic, and figured to be the closest bought brand to what she had been making herself. The variety packs are a nice, easy way to stock different kinds for our baby to enjoy... and enjoy she did for several of the flavors, though some she hated as well. All in all, we were pleased, and baby seemed pleased, though I will say, she didn't seem to like these gourmet ones any better or any worse than the less expensive <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BM6LVS\">Earth's Best Organic 2nd Dinner Variety Pack, 4 Ounce Jars (Pack of 12)</a>.<br /><br />Needless to say, I was pretty surprised to read a review about BPA in the lids at <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BM395E\">Earth's Best Organic 2nd Fruit Variety Pack, 4-Ounce Jars (Pack of 12)</a>, (and so I posted my review there as well).  I spent some time trying to verify this myself. A lot of different blogs stated it, and while I couldn't find anything definitive, here's what bothered me: Clearly Earth's Best knows people are concerned about BPA in their lids... their own facebook site is littered with people asking this same question. The admin answers these the same way... food safety and baby health is of the highest priority, call us to discuss. That's only slightly paraphrased. Going to their website, they have zero articles on BPA and none in the FAQs section either... nothing. I'm not worried enough about the issue to stop using what we purchased, but I would have felt a whole lot better about the company and their products if they would acknowledge parents' concerns and tell parents... something. Hey, we check our food in laboratory testing regularly and the the amount of BPA found in our food is X, which is so low, there are no health concerns... just say something... anything. Do you really want the onus on the customer to contact you to keep using your product?<br /><br />As I was taking the time to review their product, I decided I would call them to give them a fair chance to explain. Something, I likely wouldn't have done if I wasn't writing a review. Their office was closed... 9AM - 7PM est. Not the most convenient times for a working parent, but I will attempt to follow up and update this accordingly.<br /><br />****UPDATED (old)****<br />Just spoke to someone from customer service.  She says that the liner that comes into contact with the food is BPA free, but that there is another section of the lid behind this liner, that does contain BPA, but that section of the lid does not come in contact with the food.  I'm sure not everyone will be okay with that answer, but I'm ok with it.  I still think it should be an answer that's readily available to consumers without calling them, but I will say there was no hold time at least.\n",

      "Once upon a time, Chebe made the best pizza crust ever - great texture, thin and chewy, very tasty, even rolled out easily without sticking to pan or rolling pin.  Friends not on the gluten-free diet raved about it too.<br /><br />Not any more.  The formula used for the mix seems to have changed along with the instructions - making it easier to put together (no more baking the crust first, as we used to do, before adding toppings), but resulting in an inferior product.  It's lost the chewy texture and the great taste and is now just another over-priced GF mix - one package makes one medium-sized pizza.<br /><br />If you make it, oil your pizza pan (something that never used to be necessary) before putting the dough in it, or the pizza will stick.  And don't pile the toppings too high or add too much sauce, or the dough won't bake through in the middle.  If you're lucky, you'll get a fairly edible pizza - but you could make a good bigger pizza for less just using the pizza dough recipe in a good GF cookbook - e.g., Elizabeth Barbone's <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1891105418\">Easy Gluten-Free Baking</a>.  After all, you have to add oil, milk, cheese, and eggs to this Chebe mix - why not just mix up some dough from scratch and save yourself a lot of money?\n",

      "This mix makes an excellent gluten free pizza dough. I tried several other brands before, but their mixes came out like a batter that you level on a baking sheet and comes out cake like.  Chebe pizza mix is nothing like that. When mixed, it actually forms a dough ball the you can roll out with a rolling pin or work flat with your hands. It is gently seasoned, enough to give it an Italian flavor, but not over powering. When it is baked, the pizza crust has a slight chew to it like regular pizza dough. You can cut your pizza like normal and actually pick it up with your hands without it falling apart. I ordered it by the case based on the other excellent reviews that it got, and I don't regret it one bit.

But I was running out of options, I needed a miracle.<br /><br />You see, ever since my wife left me for the door greeter at Wal-Mart, my life has been a mess.

Instead, they are mild, buttery and nutty.  Really!  They are perfect for a snack or light meal with mild complex cheeses, pear slices, etc.<br /><br />$6.49 is a fair price, but $7.25 for shipping (the price at the time this review is written) more than doubles your cost.  Alternatively, you can buy them by the case (as few as 4 cans) directly from the Graber Olive House, but even so, the shipping cost is prohibitive for folks on the East Coast.  If that doesn't discourage you, then go all in and buy the larger size 16 olives.<br /><br />Grabers olives are unpitted, and (as with all olives) are far tastier than pitted olives.  Strangely, PITTED ripe green olives are readily available at reasonable prices (even at many ordinary grocery stores), but do not compare to Grabers unpitted olives.  You can probably buy 6 cans of pitted ripe green olives for the price of 1 can of Grabers.  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SXXJMK\">Santa Barbara Olive Co.

If I open a can, I finish it within an hour.<br /><br />Recommendation: After major grocery shopping expeditions, sit down at your computer with your reciept, and check if you can buy any of the non-perishables through Amazon. When you find items (even if more expensive than you just paid), put the item on your Amazon wish list, and add a note to the wish list of the price you just paid. Check your wish list frequently, and when you see an item you need at a bargain price, buy it.

Also I was under the illusion that I was getting more than one box of 6 biscuits for $9.99. The Term 6 pack is misleading. 1 box of 6 tiny & stale biscuits is what it should say.<br /><br />I'll never buy food off Amazon again, there's just no quality control! My advice to you is save yourself the disappointment and the hideous price\n",

      "I've been on a real Bar-kick recently, mostly for a quick breakfast on the way out to door as I'm always at least 15 minutes late to work but don't want to skip breakfast.  I started with Cliff bars but those got old.  Then I moved on to Larabars, which are good and come in some interesting flavours, but after eating them for a few weeks I decided they were too sweet for anything more than occasional consumption.<br /><br />My favorite, to date, are the 18 Rabbits Bars <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QV0M2E\">18 Rabbits Haute Diggity Date, Organic Granola Bar, 1.9-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)</a>, which are awesome.<br /><br />However, these Eat Think Smile bars were a big surprise ... so far I'd give them the silver medal behind 18 Rabbits, and will keep buying them just to keep some variety.<br /><br />What do I like about these bars?  Let me think about what I like about them ... first, they don't taste like a typical health food bar - while the box says oatmeal raisin, to me they taste more like a brownie (not quite as good as a real brownie but pretty close for a packaged bar).  The second think I really like about these bars is unlike a lot of the bars out there which are too sugary, these are just sweet enough without being sweet but more importantly their carbohydrate content comes from DIETARY FIBER.  28% DV of Dietary Fiber people.  Do you realize like 75% of Americans don't get enough Fiber in their diets?  Hello?<br /><br />So I recommend these and will keep purchasing them myself even though I got this box for free via the Vine program.<br /><br />Thank you for reading this informative review.\n",

      "Ghee (clarified butter) has been used in India for ages, it can be used as a substitue for oil or butter, in most applications. It's a healthier option to butter and the other questionable frying mediums in use today.<br /><br />A more detailed description from http://www.pcta.org/general/ghee.asp :<br />\"ghee is unsalted butter that has been baked to remove not only its butter fat solids, as in drawn butter, but also all water -- so as to produce a food that contains no molecular oxygen, and is thus extremely storable and not subject to rancidity as in normal cooking oils. The health advantages accrue from the fact that ghee contains no oxidized cholesterol, the kind which leads to free radical damage in the cells of the body. Ghee is pretty well known among nurtrition nuts, plus it's a staple within Asian Indian communities and can be purchased in specialty food stores. It looks just like butter in a jar\"<br /><br />For those new to Ghee, do bear in mind it has a unique odor and flavor that may take some getting used to. The odor is not really strong and is somewhat buttery.<br /><br />If this is your first time trying it and you don't like it, you can always use it instead of butter for baking, provided the dish you are baking has a reasonably pleasant odor of it's own. Overall, the quality of the product itself is really good and it tastes great.<br /><br />I like the small 8oz jars instead of one large one, it's easier to handle them and you don't need to scoop some out into a smaller container for daily use. Once a can is over, just pop open a new one. Also, ghee has a long shelf life and you don't need to refrigerate the unopened jars. However, if you don't plan on using up an open bottle in about a month, it helps to store the container in the refrigerator, especially in summer!\n",

      "Bought this tea only to find out that the third ingredient is Artificial Flavor, even though the front of the box has the word \"Natural\" on it and the packaging certainly gives the appearance of a natural product.  I called Good Earth and spoke to the manager of consumer affairs to find out what chemical they were putting into the flaver.  Guess what.  That information is proprietary.  Guess the artifical chemicals they are pumping into their tea are bad enough that they won't even relase that information to their consumers.  Shame on you GoodEarth!<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F6SNPS\">Good Earth Original Caffeine Free, Tea Bags, 18-Count, Boxes (Pack of 6)  [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>]\n",

      "Index: 35531\n",
      "So, there is a bit of confusion here about the ingredients in this product. Upon speaking with The Good Earth directly, I have learned that the 18-count Original Sweet & Spicy Tea (both caffeine-free and regular) have artificial flavor, whereas the 25-count boxes do not. It seems like a stupid way to differentiate, since the boxes look exactly the same, with the same exact name. I think they do this so as not to highlight the fact that any of their products have artificial flavoring. I learned from them that they originally had artificial flavor in the blend, then removed it, and received complaints because it tasted different (though probably only slightly). They then added it back to their formula, but only in the 18-count boxes. It is a \"spice flavor not found in nature,\" they claim, so I guess there's no other way to please the people who like that flavor. The first box I got was from an outlet grocery store that was produced during the in-between period when the artificial flavor had been removed from all boxes. It was really good just like that; I still enjoyed the flavor of the new version (technically the old version) that I received from Amazon, but actually not quite as much, and I'd rather have the natural version since it's natural and I like that one anyway.<br /><br /> As a note about the flavor--I really like this tea. It is, as described, sweet and spicy. It has a very cinnamon-y flavor with a lot of dimension added by all the other flavors included. I drink a few cups a day, either caffeinated or the rooibos version, depending on time of day. The flavor between these two are slightly different, but comparable. I love the fact that it is delicious without sugar and/or milk (though also delicious with either or both as well)--this is coming from someone with a serious sweet tooth. So that helps a lot, but apparently it has 3 calories per serving.<br /><br />If you like this, you may also enjoy <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E63LDS\">Celestial Seasonings Herb Tea, Bengal Spice, 20-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a>--another spicy herbal tisane that I like without sugar.

      "My wife and I are vegetarian, and after a lot of research decided to start feeding our dog this kibble. Afterall, dogs can clearly survive on vegan diets, as long as they are nutritionally balanced. The whole time she appeared fine, and there were no issues with lethargy, or fur. However, after a few months she started having uncontrolable diharrea, and loads of gas.  After a lot of vet bills and testing we were left with the suggestion to try a different food.<br /><br />So we did a 180 degree turn, and bought a no-grain high-protein food (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZNW346\">Blue Buffalo Wilderness Grain Free Dry Dog Food, Duck Recipe, 24-Pound Bag</a>). The bottom line, is that now she seems to be doing much better.  At the end of the day we never figured out what it was about the veggie food that upset her bowels, but changing food solved the problem. We are not super militant vegetarians, so this wasn't the end of the world for us.  Our mantra is minimize.<br /><br />Don't misunderstand me; I've read many good things about this veggie kibble, and there are many stories of people feeding their dog this food for many years with no problems.  So, by all means try it out.  I'm glad we did, and in all honesty I wish we could keep feeding it.  However, I only write my story so that people can be aware that this may not work for all dogs.<br /><br />UPDATE:  After a few bags of the Blue Buffalo Wilderness, we switched again to <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018CICX6\">Prairie Chicken Meal & Brown Rice Medley Dry Dog Food by Nature's Variety, 30-Pound Bag</a> and have been feeding it for around 6 months now.

      "I read a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307460169\">cookbook</a> recently where the author, in addition to giving recipes, interviewed famous and influential chefs of all sorts.  One of the questions that the chefs were asked was \"What do you eat when no one is watching?\"  In other words, what is your guilty pleasure that might not jive with your being a renowned chef.  The answers were honest and amusing.  Although I am only a foodie and not a chef, if I were asked that question my answer would be \"Hormel Corned Beef Hash.\"<br /><br />Fist, let me be honest about what this is: this is not something that you would want to eat very often if you were worried about fat or sodium content; the potatoes are dehydrated; and the corned beef tastes a little like <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0025UCGKK\">potted meat</a>.  Still, it is a real comfort food for me and I love it.<br /><br />I almost always add some freshly diced onions or shallots.  I also add either diced bell pepper or minced Serrano.  I put in it a hot skillet over medium heat and let it cook until crispy.  I flip it and while the other side is cooking I cook an egg or two in a separate skillet and place them, sunny side up, on top of the hash.  I like to finish it off with a generous dose of hot sauce.<br /><br />I buy this large size when I have guests (I have to admit that not all of my friends or family share my love for this product.)  I also purchase the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004S04X4W\">15-Ounce</a> and also the 7.5 oz can when it's just for me (and when I'm not having it for my main meal.)

      "These wholesome treats are only 1 or 2 calories per biscotti \"crouton.\" My 50 pound dog has a weight problem, and these are the only treats I can use to reward him for obedience multiple times a day.<br /><br />The biscotti don't crumble in my  pocket on a walk, and my dog even sniffs my pockets at home to ask for another one. Even though the treats are tiny, he doesn't swallow them whole. He chews them--maybe to savor them. I also put these in his <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0038WP1YC\">Ethical Pet Seek-A-Treat Shuffle Bone Dog Puzzle</a> as a reward, and he solves his puzzle with enthusiasm. Even though my dog weighs 50 pounds, one 8 oz bag lasts about a month.<br /><br />My dog has no diagnosed allergies, but his gasto-esophgial system was sensitive and irregular starting from the time we rescued him. For his weight-loss, I switched his food to <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003P9XFV4\">Blue Buffalo Longevity Dry Food for Adult Dogs, 24-Pound Bag</a>, which has no soy, wheat, corn, by-products, or preservatives. His gastro-esophogeal system happened to improve a lot and became regular. The hypo-allergenic treats did not cost much more than the regular ones at the time I first bought them, so I figured I would be safe and buy them. My dog hasn't had any problems on these treats, but the change in food might also explain it.  I'm sticking with the hypo-allergenic even though it's not eligible for free shipping.<br /><br />Having said that my dog likes these treats a lot, these are not his very favorite.  I give him a medium-sized biscuit <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00027D3QO\">Nutri-Vet Breath & Tartar Spearmint & Parsley Flavored Biscuits, 19.5 Ounce Bag</a>every few days, and he goes absolutely crazy for it. Alas, the biscuits have too many calories for me to treat him more often. I'd say my dog would rate his biscuits 10 barks for taste, whereas he would give his biscotti a solid 7 barks.<br /><br />Because the biscotti treats are tasty, made with wholesome ingredients, and very low in calories, I rate them 5 stars.  I consider liver biscotti a good investment in my dog's health. Every dog should have liver biscotti as his or her go-to treats.\n",

      "I couldn't do without these to keep my energy going and stave off hunger during long runs.  I have tried both the fruit punch and multi-flavor packets, and found the fruit punch to be delicious, but some of the flavors in the multi were slightly unpleasant; I wish I could tell you which ones they were.  Beans are less messy and much easier to eat while running than gels or shot blocks, as you can breathe more easily with a small bean in your mouth than the other items, which are thicker and harder to swallow.  One packet fits into the zipper pouch of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004KQBH52\">Fuelbelt Sprint 10-ounce Palm Holder with Pocket</a>, which I also love for longer runs.

To remove the dead gopher from the trap, push down on the upper frame arm to release the trap jaws and shake the trap and the gopher should fall out.

      "I'm a confirmed hot chocolate snob and yes, I admit I only really wanted a Keurig to make a really quick, banging cup of hot chocolate (and maybe not be on a first name basis with every employee at Dunkin Donuts).  In fact, I don't even drink coffee, so the quest for the perfect hot chocolate for the Keurig is not one I take lightly.<br /><br />Of the brands of hot chocolate I've tried that are made specifically for the Keurig, this one is the best.<br /><br />I tried a couple of brews before I reviewed this...  So here's the conclusion that I've come to:<br /><br />I have a Keurig Special Edition B60 brewer, and the first brew I did as was suggested by the maker (shake the K-Cup before brewing, brew on 8oz setting).  Of course my brewer doesn't have 8oz, so I brewed at 7.25oz, the \"middle button.\"  The result was a watery cup of hot chocolate with a fair amount of chocolate flavor, but still a little too watered down for me.  The color was really good, rich, dark, and even had some of that nice foamy goodness on the top.  I was *very* happy to see when I looked at the empty K-Cup after brewing that there was almost no powder or residue left in the K-Cup, a problem that the other hot chocolate K-Cups really suffer from no matter how hard you shake them and there was almost no thick chocolate gunk at the bottom of the mug when finished.  Awesome.  So overall, when brewed as suggested, it was the best hot chocolate I've tried for the K-Cup when prepared as-is, but not the best cup of homemade hot chocolate possible.<br /><br />The next brew I did I shook the K-Cup and brewed on the small cup setting, the 5.25oz brew.  The result was a hot chocolate that was a little thicker, beautiful color, lots of that spectacular white foam on top, something that looked like a REAL hot chocolate.  The flavor was much more defined, a lot more chocolaty, and very smooth and tasty.  Though I did notice that slightly Splenda-like aftertaste which kind of surprised me since I'm largely desensitized to that taste (thank you Fruit2O) and honestly it was ever-so-slightly just too sweet.  But wow was it good.  Still not the best hot chocolate to make at home, but really good.<br /><br />Third brew I did I did again on the 5.25oz brew, put a splash of half-and-half in the cup, then brewed.  Holy cow in a hat...  That was awesome.  Finally a substitute for my Dunkin Donuts trips.  So, so, so good.  No aftertaste, right amount of sweetness and creamy texture.  Great, rich color that looks like a melted Hershey Bar.  Right up there with the best hot chocolate one can make at home for sure.  For sure a taste that competes with hot chocolate I've tried from Dunkin Donuts.<br /><br />So rating this for me was hard...  When made, straight up as suggested, it's OK and even when it's made with less water it's pretty good.  Since I think the Keurig is designed for speedy ease-of-use, I think a lot of people are looking for and expecting that great cup of hot chocolate right out of the box.  In that way, it delivers an OK product, the best K-Cup hot chocolate available now, but not an overall great cup of hot chocolate.  But if you're willing to put two seconds worth of time into making it positively delicious, you will be very richly rewarded with fantastic hot chocolate.<br /><br />I fluctuated between rating 3 stars because, out of the box, it's only OK, and 4 stars because when adjusted it's amazing...  I ended up going 4 star with the assumption that there are a lot of people out there with a Keurig who do coffee or tea where they add creamer and/or sugar to adjust it to their taste, and I see doing this as much the same sort of thing.<br /><br />Hopefully Keurig will put out a hot chocolate soon that's amazing right out of the box.  If we could get them to talk to the Land O Lakes folks (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M5RNTS\">Cocoa Classics Hot Cocoa Drink Mix 7 Variety Pack</a>), there would never be a reason to leave the house for hot chocolate again...\n",

      "Opening Notes: this is not Grain Free Cat Food.  The ingredients specifically list brown rice. Grain Free cat food has no Rice. This is also not Evo, nor California Natural.  The tags for this product are mislabeled. It IS good cat food to use in Rotation, with your other grain free Varieties.<br /><br />Background: this was one of the cat foods I used for quite awhile after the 2007 pet food recalls (btw, this month is the 4 year anniversary of the massive recalls).  Then, there was some controversy about objects found and potato integrity in the food. I switched to Wellness Chicken (waiting for Amazon to replace), exclusively.<br /><br />Personal Experience: though I personally was unaffected due to the Wellness problems, I decided that rotation of Wet Food for cats would be a good thing.  If something went wrong with one of the foods, then they wouldn't be severely affected.  I decided to try this brand out again.  Its the only food I use that contains fish (fish is not good for kitties, can exacerbate the Vitamin B deficiency).  The cats ate enthusiastically (probably remembered the flavor), but we had a few loose stools while adjusting (they are fine now).<br /><br />This is a wholesome alternative, since the grain tends to be minimal.  The company is more than happy to answer any questions you may have regarding their food. The food is canned by Simmons, in Emporia, IL. A sinle location seems to offer more consitency between batches.<br /><br />Since it is a Rotation food - here is my general shopping list:<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TM70WY\">Weruva Green Eggs & Chicken Cat Food, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a><br />Wellness Adult Turkey Canned Cat Food (I prefer the Chicken, but until it reappears, this will do just as well).<br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFMCCM\">Felidae Canned Cat Food for Adult Cats and Kittens, Chicken and Rice Formula in Chicken Broth (Pack of 12 13 Ounce Cans)</a> (Its not grain free, but I personally don't like the mix for the regular, and neither do my cats)<br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F74248\">Innova Cat and Kitten Formula Canned Cat Food</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012PZ7U0\">Holistic Select Feline Radiant Adult and Kitten Health Chicken Meal Recipe Dry Cat Food, 3-Pound Bag</a> (I have tried to go all wet, but Baby Girl - 17, has had problems with all Grain Free, so a little dry didn't hurt her).<br /><br />I feed a little dry first thing in morning every day.  Then 1/2 can of one flavor, remainder placed in refrig plastic lid.  Then 1/2 can of another flavor, same storage.  The next day, those cans are used up by adding a little hot water and nuking from 5 to 8 secs (this depends on your microwave and amount of food).  The next day, we have 5.5 oz can of Weruva split between 3 cats, and 1/2 can of the last flavor.  The next day we have another 5.5 oz can, and the remainder of the previous can.  That is four days, fifth day we are back to the beginning.<br /><br />Conclusion: Recommended as a Rotation or Primary food.  Cats give it 3 paws up, a little less expensive than pure grain free.  I suggest, if you can - getting some sample cans to try out on your cat(s) first.  I was a LITTLE worried about potato in Innova and Potato in Weruva, but with Rotation, there seems to be no problem.\n",

      "I have 3 cats, currently aged 11, 7 and 8 months.  Innova cat & kitten food takes care of all three with canned food that is high in protein, lower in fat and carbs, and has a taste all 3 cats love.  I do not buy from Amazon as I've found a better deal from a website that starts with C and sounds like the nickname for Chewbaca.  I've compared this to <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ANCEI6\">Wellness Grain-Free Canned Cat Food, CORE Chicken/Turkey/Chicken Liver Recipe, 24-Pack of 5-1/2-Ounce Cans</a> (which I still have in rotation once in a while), and the stats were almost identical.  Personally I think Wellness smells a little better to me, but the cats love that funkier aroma of Innova.  I could care less about chunks of carrots - I know they're useless as-is to cats, so I just see that as little pieces of fiber.  I'm more interested in the protein, fat, carbs and moisture content, and the stats match up almost exactly to Wellness Core, and for quite a bit less.  I get a case for $19.99 with free shipping from the *other* website I buy from for pet food. I compared the cat/kitten food to the indoor cat food and somehow the indoor/weight formula has almost the same calories with less protein and more fat... so I'll be sticking to the regular formula and working on more exercise for the cats.<br /><br />All in all, I highly recommend Innova Cat & Kitten formula!\n",

I most often brew this tea in my Sunbeam Tea Drop machine using distilled water and it is suberb.  The aromaa is full and the taste is brilliant.<br /><br />I first came across this tea in a Singapore hotel room brewed in tea bags using tap water.  It is also very good in this form.  From my experience I think it would be difficult to get a bad cup!\n",

      "I used to buy Ceylon labeled tea exported from middle eastern countries <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5ZMY\">Ahmad 500g Loose Ceylon Tea, 1.23-Ounce Packet (Pack of 4)</a> for around $12 per kilo, only to later learn about high mountain genuine (lion&sword seal) Ceylon from Sri Lanka.  Being able to buy the real thing on Amazon for $20 per kilo was an amazing find for me, as I brew a Gallon per day using a drip style coffee maker.  Only 1g per cup is needed here, not the typical 2g per cup you may need with cheaper loosely packed leafy Ceylons, so each box can yeild over a hundred 8oz cups of tea - as no leaf rinsing is needed.<br />This is NOT some low quality crushed leaf dust, just a fine packed leaf that requires a paper filter to brew to yield a crystal clear amber tea - don't use a hole steeper - only a fine screen will do.  This is an affordable leaf type especially for ice tea lovers.  This malty neutral pH tea, combines well with fruit, spices, citrus, and even milk.<br />UPDATE:  I'm just about to reorder and wanted to share that drip method ice tea *makers <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002EDZWSG\">Mr. Coffee TM3-2W 3-Quart Iced Tea Maker</a> like me - can save even more money by using only 1/2g per cup - and you will still get a dark amber full flavor tea.  So for every gallon (16 cups) I brew, I use just 8g of this tea leaf, with 16x yellow 1g Splenda packets, and get perfect lightly sweet sugar free tea every time!  That gets my cost per large 8oz cup of fresh brewed no preservative iced tea down under 10¢.  Flavor with a tablespoon of cranberry or grapefruit juice for an extra kick.  This tea the best balance of quality and afford ability.  I have tried other Dilmah teas including; Ran Watte, Uda Watte, Supreme, Earl Grey, and these little blue boxes are the only ones worth reordering.\n",

      "Country Collection Spuds 'N Chives Potato Soup fed our family of four for about $7. The directions called for 8 cups of either water or milk; my wife added 4 cups of each. We enjoyed the soup with buttered bread.<br /><br />One package of soup: $3.17 (we saved a couple dollars on a promotional deal)<br />4 cups of milk: $1.80<br />8 slices of bread: $1.40<br />Butter: $0.55<br />Total: $6.92<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO7EU0\">Country Collection Spuds 'N Chives Potato Soup</a> is tasty. We added a couple drops of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051C0KJS\">Lea and Perrins Worcestershire Sauce</a> to each bowl. As I mentioned earlier, one package fed us all, including our two sons (ages 9 and 8). If you have two teenage boys, you probably should make a second package to fill them up.<br /><br />The soup's ingredients are: dehydrated potatoes, chopped onions, parsley, partially hydrogenated soybean oil, wheat flour, hydrolyzed soy protein, lactose, maltodextrin, sodium caseinate, chicken fat, salt, dipotassium phosphate, turmeric & silicon dioxide (added to prevent caking).<br /><br />These are the preparation instructions on the package: \"Empty contents into medium saucepan. Add 8 cups of water or for a richer soup add milk. Bring to a boil. Cover and simmer for 20 minutes. To thicken, remove lid and let stand for 5-10 minutes. (A crock pot works great.) You may want the soup to simmer for a couple of minutes so the little potatoes can soften.\"<br /><br />The package also lists these variations: \"For a great chowder, you can add jack cheese or mozzarella and the add oysters, clams, or throw in some corn. Garnish with bacon bits and for color, add some chopped pimento.\"<br /><br />In summary, this is a suitable (and affordable) meal for a fall or winter day. The potato soup is good by itself but I encourage you to try the variations recommended by the company.<br /><br />Rating: Five stars.\n",

The first shipment arrived with an added surprise - each box has a Spongebob Squarepants toy inside! Our sons (ages 8 and 7) happily prepare their mother's morning bowl of cereal, knowing each serving gets them one step closer to completing the 8-piece collection.<br /><br />Of course, my wife would eat Chocolate Cheerios with or without the toy. She eats the cereal with 2% milk and a cup of black coffee because, really, you don't need cream or sugar when you're eating a bowl of chocolate cereal.<br /><br />Getting to the basics: the cereal was tightly packaged with no damage; the expiration date extends at least 12 months out, so there's no mad dash to consume six boxes at once; and the price is competitive with the supermarkets we regularly patronize. The added convenience of the cereal arriving at our doorstep rather than hauling it home in shopping bags is a bonus.<br /><br />Personally, I don't touch the stuff.

While other MaraNatha products may not be my personal favorites, the company has produced a winning product with its dark chocolate almond spread.  The product is velvety and delicious and belongs in any chocolate lover's pantry.<br /><br />The dark chocolate almond spread is easily retrieved from the container and no stirring is required.  This product tastes awesome on toast, banana pieces, mixed with ice cream or oatmeal or straight out of the jar (my personal favorite).  It is so smooth that I could envision one using this spread as an icing for cupcakes or cake.<br /><br />There is no indication on the jar that the product must be refrigerated.  I typically refrigerate my peanut butters and other nut butters so I did that with this product and it did make the product more stiff.  If you wanted to use this as a frosting, you would need to heat it slightly after refrigeration.<br /><br />A serving is 2 tablespoons and has 180 calories, 14 grams of fat (3 grams saturated), 2 grams of dietary fiber, 9 grams of sugar and 4 grams of protein.  The product's ingredients include: dry roasted almonds, evaporated can juice, palm oil, cocoa powder, non-fat dry milk, canola oil, soy lecithin, natural vanilla flavor and salt.<br /><br />While the product is vegetarian, it is not vegan due to the milk content and those sensitive to soy should be cautious.

I wait a few minutes, allowing the food to get soft, drain the water and then place in the cat dish.  Its a great \"hot\" food alternative for the cat who is too finicky to eat other types of raw food.<br /><br />Nature's Variety is easier to portion.  Each chunk of food comes as a disk around the size of a fifty-cent piece with about half an inch of thickness.  Once softened, I have cut this a bit with a fork, but for the most part, my cat likes it so much she moves it off her plate to attack it whole.  The Stella and Chewy food comes in smaller tater tot shapes which unfortunately, depending upon the way they are packed to be shipped can arrive crushed.  For some reason, the crushed food does not appeal to my cat.  In addition, it is difficult to decide just how much food to give the cat--once reconstituted, the food will go to waste if the cat, like mine, decides not to eat it all.  Nature's Variety's size makes this easier to manage and will result in less waste.<br /><br />Bottom line?  Nature's Variety Instinct Raw Boost Bites Freeze-Dried Treats, Chicken, makes for a seemingly delicious entree item for my very picky cat who purrs while she eats it.  Easy to portion out and reconstitute, it makes for a raw treat to \"serve\" on top of kibble or just alone.  Recommended.<br />Diana Faillace Von Behren<br />\"reneofc\"\n",

      "I am a big fan of these treats, which I was given a sample to try. First, they were very easy to break into smaller pieces, in comparison to some other freeze dried treats I've bought like freeze-dried liver. This is important as I like to use treats for training and need to break them into much smaller pieces than most treats are sold. I also will break them up to use inside puzzle toys like the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KZ8FWE\">Nina Ottosson  Tornado </a>. The ingredients are excellent, and being freeze-dried, have a good shelf life compared to some soft treats. Also important to me is they are made in the USA. I'm refusing to buy treats made in China as many dog treats are. Just too many unanswered questions.<br /><br />Most important of course is whether my dog likes them. Now, my dog is not very picky, but he definitely reacts with more enthusiasm in training according to how much he likes the treat being used. And boy, does he LOVE these! He was sniffing around the shipping box even before I opened it which isn't something he typically does. Chicken is definitely high on his list of favorite foods, and these seem to have a very desirable smell and taste for my dog. I will definitely put them on my list to buy again.\n",

      "This review is for <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041R1UM0\">Wissotzky Red Tea with Chamomile, Lime & Honey, 1.41-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> There are other flavors I like very much that I refer to at the bottom of this review. These are all non-caffeine, high antioxidant herbal teas that are always startling delicious to anyone I have served them too.<br /><br />Wissotzky makes a whole range of teas, including those with black tea and those with green tea. The ones I discuss here are my personal favorites.<br /><br />Wissotzky Teas are rather renowned though, personally, I hadn't heard of them until I was teaching at my University's summer law program at University of Haifa in Israel. You pick them up at any supermarket there -- but you have to special order them over here in the US.<br /><br />Having to live in dormitory-style living while teaching over there, the tea was convenient but I was most startled by how really delicious it was. I am not a big tea drinker -- occasionally herbal tea in the winter -- but I was drinking this tea every day during the very hot Israeli summer.<br /><br />I brought quite a bit back with me and ordered more here. I often offered it to colleagues during meetings in my office and they were invariably struck by how unexpectedly delicious it is.<br /><br />So now I give boxes as gifts. And the recipients often hint they wouldn't mind another gift they so love it.<br /><br />Serving the tea at one of my group work meetings has become a hallmark tradition and puts a positive tone as we launch into a 3 hour work session.<br /><br />For more information:<br />These herbal teas are made from the Rooibus (Red Bush) plant from South Africa.<br /><br />The only authentic Rooibus tea is from South Africa -- though many companies claim theirs is Rooibus though not from South Africa.<br /><br />It is not unlike that genuine Champagne can only come from the Champagne region of France but firms market sparkling wines from other regions prepared by the \"Methode Champenoise.\" In that case, there are excellent Methode Champenoise sparkling wines that rival genuine Champagne (though being a champagne lover -- I still find a taste unique to genuine Champagne.)<br /><br />However my experience is that non-South African Rooibus Tea is not as good nor does it have the medicinal and homeopathic qualities that genuine Rooibus tea does.<br /><br />As to the variations: Wissotzky sells the pure Rooibus Tea (which does not seem to be here on Amazon) and 3 flavored versions: 1. with Chamomile, Lime & Honey,[[B0041R1UM0 Wissotzky Red Tea with Chamomile, Lime & Honey, 1.41-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)]] (my and most people's favorite)  2. with Cinnamon & Vanilla <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041R00WG\">Wissotzky Red Tea with Cinnamon and Vanilla, 1.41-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>(my second most favorite and many people's first choice) and 3. with Rosehip & Passion Fruit <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041R1DYA\">Wissotzky Red Tea with Rosehip and Passion fruit, 1.41-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> (which I also really like and again is some people's favorites.)<br /><br />As mentioned at the start of this review -- Wissotzky makes a whole range of teas, both with and without flavors, herbal, black tea and green tea (which has its own homeopathic benefits.) I've tried many of the other herbal and enjoy them; I personally stay away from caffeine as my system doesn't handle it well.\n",

      "No \"real\" Indian cook would do anything but use all individual spices to make a curry - ha!  \"Real Indian cooks\" use spice mixtures like garam masala all the time.<br /><br />This is more than just spices, like curry powder.  It has onions, lime, and so forth.  As soon as I opened the packet, my wife began craving naan, Indian bread - the fragrance was just wonderful, and reminiscent of what you smell in an Indian Restaurant.<br /><br />I used about two pounds of chicken with bones and skin on to one packet, browned the chicken very lightly, and added the packet of paste.  I should have poured off some chicken fat before adding the paste.  Then I added about 2.5 cups of water and simmered for about a half hour covered, and gave it more than 5 minutes on high - basically I was just judging the reduction - I stirred about once a minute during that part.<br /><br />In the meantime, the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0022SZGZM\">Wolfgang Puck WPPCR005 5-Quart Electronic Pressure Cooker</a> was working on the rice.  The rice was done well before the 25 minute period was up.<br /><br />There are some great ideas in these reviews.  I have used a peeler on zuccini and yellow squash to make thin sheets of vegetable for sauteing, peeling all the way through the veggie - I would do that while the stuff was cooking for 25 minutes and add it just as you entered the \"five minutes on high\" period, add some to the sauce and turn it - I think it would taste great.  For the first batch I was just getting a baseline.  Yogurt was a good idea, maybe a little sour cream? Or heavy cream?<br /><br />Eggplant is another classic veggie that goes into curry. Of course, you can make homemade Indian cheese - you take a bunch of cow's milk, curdle it with lemon juice, yogurt or cultured buttermilk, and strain it in cheesecloth, three layers, pressing it under a plate that is weighted with a bowl of water after it drains to form it - look for recipes for paneer or panir on food.com.<br /><br />The point is that letting a butcher cube your chicken and mixing cubed chicken with water and this paste, simmering for 30 min, boil on high uncovered for 5 minutes, let sit for three - that is the basics and you can do so much more.  I argue that it is not harder to make a simple chicken curry using this paste than macaroni and cheese. I think the curry tastes better - your 3 year old may disagree :-).<br /><br />But the paste is essentially a spice and flavoring mixture.  If you love mixing and matching - if you always have onion soup mix in your pantry and have never made onion soup, well, this could be a winner.  I've taken a course in Indian Cooking at the CIA in Hyde Park, NY. I still have a mortar and pestle n my kitchen, because to do it \"right\" you need to grind your spices and it is marginally better to use a crushing mortar than a chopper grinder.  And you need about half a dozen reasonably fresh spices - cumin, cardamom (green and black) and black peppercorn, mustard seed and oil to make a spice cake, coriander, tumeric, nutmeg, cinnamon, dried ginger (I don't grind this myself), dried chili -  there is an article in wikipedia that lists many Indian spices.  You want to grind the spices the day you use them, in most cases.<br /><br />Most people (me, these days) are unwilling to do this, so they take shortcuts.<br /><br />This is a shortcut.  And the flavor is as good as I've ever had in a premix like this.  I've had worse in restaurants.<br /><br />My wife has a very, very low tolerance for picante food (spicy hot).  She found the curry spicy and tolerable - she felt that the food was spicy hot but it was not at all intolerable.<br /><br />I have a high tolerance for heat.  I found the \"hot\" spiciness almost unnoticeable, while the rest of the spicing was bold and simple but not excessive for Indian food, (where they use a lot more spice in one dish than, say, the City of Cleveland, Ohio does in a week). The flavors were simple, and no one flavor predominated.  The spicy flavor penetrated the entire piece of chicken during the cooking - this was true of both the thighs and the whole split breast that I used.<br /><br />If you want a spice mixture that makes a good simple curry and is easy to use, and you are willing to forgo the subtle but sublime feeling of accomplishment that you get when you perfectly create something so tasty that it gets you high while you are eating it, if you are willing to \"settle\" for good, tasty food, this curry paste is a good choice.<br /><br />Yes, there is Indian food like that, I cooked it when I was in that class and for some time after, but I'm older and my new wife likes Indian food some but not all that much, so this is perfect.  I don't consider that the point of this product - that you can hand spice something so that it is better than a commercial curry does not reflect badly on this product at all - this is five star curry paste.\n",

      "The standard curry Paste by Kitchens of India (KoI) makes for a quick and easy method to making a rich and flavorful curry.  To make the curry it is a simple process that only takes me no more than 30 minutes to make.  Throw about 1.0 lbs of chicken in a pan (you could use fish or vegetables if you want).  Add the entire packet of paste + 1 cup of water.  Just mix until the paste blends with the water and dissolves and well there you go!  Just simmer for about 20-25 minutes before turning the heat up to high for about 3-5 minutes and you are done.  A delicious curry with chicken(or vegetable/fish) in under 30 minutes.<br /><br />The curry itself tastes best when hot, in my opinion.  There is a mild spice to this curry and while it is a good quality product, this curry also tends to taste a little on the salty side.  It is also a bit sweeter than the other chicken curry that KoI sells (Butter Chicken Curry).  While I do enjoy this curry it is not my favorite.  That goes to <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V17MLS\">Kitchens of India Paste for Butter Chicken Curry</a> which has a bit more spice to it.<br /><br />OVERALL this is a good curry that doesn't have too big of a bite in terms of spice.  It has rich flavor and can go best with chicken, though vegetables and fish also work well for this curry.  Being easy to make in under 30 minutes, this is a good mild curry that will not disappoint.<br /><br />* Nutritional Information ** (Entire packet)<br />Each packet is 3.5oz (100g) and contains FOUR Servings.

I am a bit disappointed because I don't think it's as good.  However, I would not characterize it as bad either. It has a slight clove-ish flavor to it that I do not find unpleasant. Those who like really hot curry will probably want to add some chili flakes to it.<br /><br />When making the KOI curries I add more meat than the recipe calls for, which extends the dish without loss of flavor.  I usually serve this over rice, but I think it's good also with potatoes and peas.  Skipping the chicken altogether, this curry paste could easily be used to make a very good vegetarian curry.<br /><br />I will buy this again.\n",

      "Although I've only been able to try three of Caribou's k cup blends (Mahogany as well as <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00474OR8G\">Caribou Coffee, Caribou Blend, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00474VPLI\">Caribou Coffee, Daybreak Morning Blend, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a>), I've found that Caribou consistently produces the highest quality k cups. They are head and shoulders above their competitors like Green Mountain and Van Houtte.<br /><br />I should mention that Caribou's Daybreak blend is far and away my favorite k cup flavor of the 20 or so I've been able to sample so far. But I enjoy a flavorful medium roast. My boyfriend, on the other hand, prefers an extra bold dark roast. After our favorable experience with the Caribou brand before, we picked up a box of this coffee and hoped that it would be a great choice for a dark blend.<br /><br />Let me just say that Mahogany is full of smokey delicious flavor. It's quite strong and dark, but there is no rancid bitterness or acidity that accompanies a lot of the dark roasts. This coffee packs a powerful punch. Although that isn't normally my thing, I can enjoy a cup of this with milk and a bit of sweetener. My boyfriend adores it, though, and it has become a staple blend for him. I will still drink this on occasion, but it's a bit too potent for me.<br /><br />I think this is the best dark roast I've had the chance to try.\n",

      "<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001F5RRSC\">Primula Products Flowering Tea Set</a>I'm a big Green Tea drinker. I usually made my tea with the loose tea leaves, but then a friend told me about blooming teas. I wasn't really expecting much but I liked the looks of the Tea Pot and figured I'd give it a try. Boy was I surprised!I dropped my Tea bulb in the Primula Tea Pot. I chose Camellia Joy which is Green Tea with Acaiberry. I poured hot water over the bulb and couldn't believe the beautiful flower that began to unfold in the Pot. It reminded me of watching those nature movies in Biology class so many years ago when they'd speed up the timed pictures to show a seed blossoming in fast motion! It was incredible to watch it bloom! I then poured myself a cup of the healthy steaming hot green tea and was pleasantly surprised at the aroma and light but flavorful taste. I poured hot water over the flower 3 more times and each cup tasted as delicious as the first. I've decided this will make a fabulous birthday present for my Mom and a great present for my mother in law come Christmas time.<br />But the best part is the  Tea Pot itself. It is made of a special glass that is able to withstand boiling hot water on the stove, or holding cold tea in the fridge.It doesn't crack with temperature change, it's light-weight yet sturdy, and I love the classic design and feel of it in my hand. I leave it out with the blooming flower still in in it as a centerpiece when my friends come over. It never fails that they notice it and ask me to demonstrate how it works. I love entertaining with it and make sure I keep plenty of the flowering bulbs on hand for those drop-ins.  And the glass infuser that comes with it is great as well. It sits down inside the Tea Pot and is perfect for making a cup of loose tea for a change. It brews right inside the Tea Pot and makes a perfect blend every time, without the loose tea leaves getting into my cup. Needless to say, if you love Tea, want to start trying Tea, or know of a Tea lover, this is the perfect gift for yourself or friends. I highly recommend it. The price is right and the value is extraordinary!\n",

      "Perhaps they should have given this bar a different name, maybe \"Dark Chocolate for Beginners\". It is a \"Dark Chocolate\" bar but with only 54% cacao. It is still more than typical milk chocolate (in the 30s), but it may confuse fans of dark chocolate. This is more of a bridging-the-gap type of a chocolate. For someone coming to this from the off-the-shelf mass-market milk chocolate, this is not as \"bitter\" as typical dark chocolate, so if you want to eat healthier chocolate, this may be an option. It is also sweet, sweeter than most of the dark chocolates (60%) I recall trying out, and it does not have the \"bitter\" taste.<br /><br />However, for someone coming to this from the 60% and 70% and 80% dark chocolate, this may come as a surprise, as it is sweeter and it doesn't have the high percentage of cocoa one would expect. Newman also has a 70% \"Super Dark\" chocolate <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002NHSQRM\">Newman's Own Organics Super Dark (70%) Chocolate Bar, 3.25-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)</a> but I haven't tried that so I can't really compare. However, the choice of a name (70% being called Super Dark) is a hint that these are perhaps intended more for the mass-market grocery store consumer, not the dark chocolate connoisseur.<br /><br />Nutrition-wise, the whole chocolate bar (2.25oz or 64 grams) has 330 calories and it provides one-third of the RDA fat calories and two-thirds of the RDA saturated fat calories. There is 0% cholesterol, 0% trans-fat and only traces of sodium (5mg). Also good is 4g of fiber and 3g of protein, but a jumping up and down 28g of sugars. It is candy after all :-) The cocoa is Rainforest Alliance certified.<br /><br />The bar is made in a way that can be broken in six (probably uneven unless you are careful) pieces, so theoretically you can break it into six servings, which significantly lowers the calories and fat intake. More realistically, one-third of the bar is a reasonable compromise for one person per day, bringing it down to 110 calories with 10% RDA fat and 22% RDA saturated fat. (the numbers are based on the standard 2000 calorie diet found in most of the food labels).\n",

      "I received 1 bar via the Amazon Vine program to review. Let me just say I love chocolate in any form, but dark chocolate is probably 4th down on the list of favorites.  That being said, I find most dark chocolate is either too bitter for my liking, often leaving me with a slight pucker in my mouth and/or a chalky after-taste.  Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate was a pleasant surprise on the taste front.  Yes, it's dark chocolate, but no bitter aftertaste.  It's smooth and just sweet enough to remind me of bittersweet chocolate, more than dark.<br /><br />The reason for 4 and not 5 stars has more to do with the price of being environmentally aware.  Perhaps that explains the price hike on this bar of chocolate versus some others?  I love that Newman's company puts a portion of its proceeds back into helping others, and that too may explain the price hike, but I don't have to like it.  Not when other brands are just as tasty and cost much less.<br /><br />Similar chocolate in quality and taste: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKV04E\">Dagoba Dark (59%) Semisweet Bar, 2.0-Ounces Bars (Pack of 12)</a> focuses too on being environmentally friendly.

      "I used to hate dark chocolate. I didn't care for its dryer texture or bitter taste. Then I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes and chocolate pretty much became a no-no. Through careful experimentation though, I discovered I could occasionally enjoy a square of dark chocolate with higher cacao percentages because they have less sugar. I began to appreciate the flavor of chocolate without the milky sweetness and have since been a big fan.<br /><br />Keeping that in mind I'm always trying new brands and blends in search of the perfect dark chocolate bar. Unfortunately, as much as I love Newman's Own as a company and many of their other products this chocolate was just not for me. It's too sweet and the vanilla taste came through strong. It melted into a watery consistency in my mouth and almost had an alcohol-like tang to it. Once I'd noticed that tang I checked the ingredient list and sure enough it's made with chocolate liquor which some may like but I personally don't care for when I reach for dark chocolate.<br /><br />At only 54% cocoa this is pretty low on the spectrum of darker chocolates and with it's texture would be a great introduction to dark chocolate for someone who doesn't like it usually. It kind of reminded me of an oversweetened version of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002RBRY0Y\">Lindt Lindor Truffles Dark Chocolate, 60-Count Box</a>'s centers.

      "I am a lover of dark chocolate.  Unfortunately, this chocolate will disappoint true dark chocolate lovers.  Its waaaay too sweet!  Its not bad chocolate - its creamy, its rich, its got good cacao flavor, but they put too much sugar in it.  I prefer the very complex, slightly bitter, very dark (71% cacao) <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029JI0CK\">Dove Silky Smooth Dark Chocolate</a> instead.  Also, the Newman's chocolate is broken into six relatively large 1.5 x 1.25 inch squares - IMO just a little too large to just put one square in your mouth and allow it to melt away.  The Dove is broken into 1 x 1 inch squares - the perfect size to melt on your tongue.  Even the wrapper on the Dove is better as it is true foil and easily allows you to keep the remaining chocolate wrapped up tight.  The Newman's comes in gold paper meant to look like foil, but its only paper - it does not close well.  Overall, disappointed.\n",

      "I received a sample of one Newman's dark-chocolate bar through the Vine program. I live in a part of the country where it is warm in the winter and the bar arrived slightly melted. I put it in the refrigerator to return it to a solid state--and I can imagine the shudders of chocolate connoisseurs since chocolate is not supposed to be refrigerated. It causes \"blooming,\" a grayish discoloration of the shine on the chocolate. The chocolate actually did discolor, but that didn't matter to me personally, because I love cold chocolate bars which are crunchy to the teeth and smooth to the tongue.<br /><br />I could go into all the ways that Newman's Own is a great company (it is), the fact that the ingredients in this chocolate are organic and healthier than those in a regular chocolate bar (they are), and that there's a lot of solid research that dark chocolate is good for your health (it is), but since several other reviewers have already covered all that and done a great job, I'll stick to the main issue:<br /><br />How does it taste?<br /><br />In my opinion--and I love chocolate--this bar tastes great. And particularly great for dark chocolate. Many regular dark-chocolate bars are, for my personal preference, rather too bitter. The bitterness that is supposed to be there as an essential part of the flavor experience of dark chocolate is present in this Newman's Own bar, but not to the extent that the bar doesn't offer a sweet treat.<br /><br />As for the texture, to me it felt quite smooth as it melted on my tongue. The aftertaste is excellent. It tastes just as good as the initial bite of the candy.<br /><br />What about the price? I wrote Amazon about the price today, and they wrote back it is going to cost $25.85. The suggested retail price appears to be $35.88 for 12 bars which comes to a little under $3 per 2.25 oz. (64 gm) bar. The Amazon discounted price comes to about $2.16 per bar, which is cheaper than any other source on the Internet is currently selling it.<br /><br />How does it compare to it's conventional, U.S. competitor, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IXWBZG\">Hershey's Extra Dark Chocolate Bar</a>? The Hershey's bars are larger, weighing in at 3.52 oz., and they come in a pack of 14 selling for $31 on Amazon. That's $2.21 for a larger bar. I haven't tasted that bar, but the reviewers who have claim much the same thing I am for this bar for the Hershey bar's taste, that it has great flavor with no bad aftertaste.<br /><br />In the end, since the taste is at least as good as its conventional competitor, the choice for a consumer as to whether to choose this product will probably come down to two main things: a desire to support the company selling it and/or the fact that this bar is organic and has a healthier sugar in it. As for myself, considering those two things, I would personally choose this bar.\n",

      "I really like NEWMAN'S OWN ORGANIC DARK CHOCOLATE BAR. It's not as bitter as some dark chocolates like <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G0MG0K\">Ghirardelli Chocolate Squares Dark Chocolate 60% Cacao, 5.25-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6)</a> but that's due to the lower cocoa content, 54% vs. 60% and higher in others, so it can be a good or bad thing depending on how you like your dark chocolate to taste.<br /><br />For me, this is just right; not sweet like milk chocolate and not bitter at all! My only complaint would be that I wish the bar was scored so that the pieces would be a little bit smaller. Right now the bar is somewhat scored into six squares, but those are pretty big squares, so you have to break them in half to let it sit comfortably in your mouth and let it dissolve.<br /><br />That's really the best way to eat dark chocolate: put a small piece in your mouth and let it dissolve slowly . NEWMAN'S OWN DARK CHOCOLATE starts melting almost immediately into a chocolate cream that coats your tongue and the roof of your mouth, so that you get that wonderful taste just enough to satisfy a sweet craving.<br /><br />I highly recommend it to those who love chocolate, but want to skip the milk chocolate and find that other dark chocolates are too bitter. NEWMAN'S OWN DARK CHOCOLATE will satisfy that craving without making you go overboard.\n",

      "THE QUICK TAKE:  Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate is a great chocolate option.  At 54% cocoa solids, it's just over the edge of dark chocolate.  So it makes a nice change for those wanting dark chocolate that isn't so dark.  And, it's sustainably and responsibly produced - making it as guilt-free as chocolate gets.  The price at Amazon varies and can be high, so you'll need to look at the current price and your other options to decide what works for you.<br /><br />TASTE AND TEXTURE:  To have a little fun, we did a taste comparison to some other chocolate we had in the house.  The Newman's Own Dark Chocolate compared well to other premium and organic chocolate we had. It's decidedly darker, less sweet and firmer than a milk chocolate, with a very nice texture both to chew and on the tongue.  And it has some really nice subtleties to the flavor.  But it's not nearly as strong as what aficionados would consider a \"dark\" chocolate.  So it's a good option that might just hit the (bitter)sweet spot you are looking for in chocolate.<br /><br />PRICE:  These bars are relatively expensive.  That's to be expected for a premium chocolate that's organically produced.  We're lucky enough to have a lot of options for locally for organic chocolate.  Newman's Own is an excellent product, but you will want to compare it to the other options available to you.<br /><br />PRODUCTION: There are two important aspects that make this chocolate as guilt-free as chocolate gets:<br /><br />First, organic production.  Newman's Own has one of the largest organic chocolate sourcing operations in the world, which is highly commendable.  So you and your family get great tasting chocolate without consuming other things you don't want to eat; and, you also get the knowledge that the producers are working to minimize the impact of your consumption on the places where the chocolate is grown.<br /><br />Second, responsible sourcing.  Far too few people know that most of the world's cocoa production is tainted by child labor and often forced labor - or, in plain terms, slavery.  If that's news to you, Google chocolate slavery for some eye-opening information.  Or have a look at some of the Amazon listings, such as <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GAN1VQ\">Bitter Chocolate: The Dark Side of the World's Most Seductive Sweet</a>.<br /><br />All of that is a lot to fit into a chocolate bar - but Newman's Own has done that, and more, and offers you a lot of excellent options in chocolate.  If this one doesn't suit you, there are several more on Amazon.\n",

      "Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate bar is a tasty, fairly creamy chocolate bar.  One bite will satisfy your mid-afternoon chocolate craving and hopefully help you make it through the rest of the day.  Of course, any bite of chocolate around that time would probably do the same, so why choose this one?<br /><br />Its socially responsible.  The cocoa beans are grown on rainforest certified farms. From their website, \"The Rainforest Alliance Certified(tm) seal guarantees that the cocoa in our Signature Series was grown on farms that meet comprehensive standards for sustainable farming, protecting soil, waterways and wildlife habitat as well as the rights and welfare of workers, their families and communities.\"<br /><br />Its organic.  Newman's Own is certified by Oregon Tilth.  If organic foods are important to you, Oregon Tilth certification is your guarantee that high standards have been met.<br /><br />Its simple.  Organic evaporated cane juice, organic chocolate liquor, organic cocoa butter, organic soy lecithin, and organic vanilla.<br /><br />Its yummy.  54% cocoa means its intensely chocolatey.  There is a hint of sweetness, but it retains the bitterness dark chocolate fans like.  Not too creamy, not too dry.<br /><br />Compared to a few other dark chocolate bars, Newman's Own stands up pretty well.  I did a little taste test with the following: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001988CN4\">Organic Dark Chocolate with Almonds - 3.5 oz Bar</a> was the best, but it had an unfair advantage with the addition of almond bits. It was a little creamier than Newman's Own. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00016XLU4\">Organic Dark Chocolate - Regular, 59% cocoa, 12 Units / 2 oz</a> was almost indistinguishable from Newman's Own. Same texture and very similar flavor, perhaps slightly more intense. Trader Joe's Fair Trade Swiss Dark chocolate had 71% cocoa so it had a drier texture.  I even tried one by Ikea, which was inexpensive and chocolatey, but actually my least favorite.  It did not appear to be fair trade or organic.<br /><br />Overall, a good solid organic fair trade dark chocolate bar.  Dark chocolate fans will like it, milk chocolate fans might be converted.\n",

      "Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary:<br />**** Recommended with warm fuzzies.<br /><br />I just received my single 2.25-ounce bar this morning and it was a good thing that I already ate breakfast as I nibbled (instead of chomped) on this with my morning coffee.  I have always liked all of Newman's line of foods, because they taste good and are made of high-quality ingredients, and because his foundation donates hundreds of millions of dollars to charities throughout the world.  (And I love his movies! :-)  Paul Newman walked the philanthropic walk in helping to make the world a better place.<br /><br />This 54% cocoa dark chocolate bar has an all-organic ingredient list that is free of artificial sweetener and extraneous additives and fillers, which is all too common in chocolates, candies, and foods these days.<br /><br />Note that, at the time of this review's writing, the \"Ingredients\" and \"Nutrition Facts\" listed on Amazon's site for this dark chocolate bar are actually copied from another \"Newman's\" chocolate bar, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002NHYQQC\">Newman's Own Organics Milk Chocolate Bar, 2.25-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)</a> , and so this information that is currently listed on Amazon's site for this dark chocolate does NOT apply to this product; it refers to Newman's Milk Chocolate.  Hopefully, Amazon will correct the listings in these two sections for this product.<br /><br />Amazon's \"Ingredients\" listing: Organic Milk Chocolate (Organic Evaporated Cane Juice, Organic Cocoa Butter, Organic Whole Milk Powder, Organic Chocolate Liquor, Organic Soy Lecithin [An Emulsifier], Organic Vanilla), Natural Coffee Flavor.<br /><br />Actual Wrapper's \"Ingredients\" listing: Organic Dark Chocolate (Organic evaporated cane juice, organic chocolate liquor, organic cocoa butter, organic soy lecithin [an emulsifier], organic vanilla).<br /><br />Wrapper's \"Nutrition Facts\" listing (with Amazon's corresponding \"Nutrition Facts\" listing, that actually apply to Newman's Milk Chocolate bar, in parentheses):<br /><br />Calories:  330 (340)<br />Calories from Fat: 200 (190)<br />Total Fat:  22g 34%DV (23g 35%DV)<br />Saturated Fat:  13g 65%DV (12g 60%DV)<br />Monounsaturated and Trans Fat: 0g (0g)<br />Cholesterol:  0g 0%DV (5mg 2%DV)<br />Sodium:  5mg (30mg)<br />Total Carbohydrate: 37g 12%DV (37g 12%DV)<br />Fiber:  4g 16%DV (1g 4%DV)<br />Sugars:  28g (33g)<br />Protein:  3g (3g)<br />Vitamin A:  0% (2%)<br />Vitamin C:  0% (2%)<br />Calcium:  2% (20%)<br />Iron:  10% (15%)<br /><br />So Newman's Own Organics Milk Chocolate Bar has more vitamins, calcium, and iron due to its use of milk, while the dark chocolate has more fiber and less sodium.  Many people do not consider chocolate to be a high-fiber food, but dark chocolate (not milk chocolate) ranks among the top-20 for high-fiber foods.  Dark chocolate is loaded with flavonoids that act as antioxidants, keeping your heart healthy and reducing oxidative stress.  Flavonoids also balance hormones in your body, and they activate endothelial nitric oxide synthase levels in your body (biochemical gibberish that translates to \"helps regulate your blood pressure\" :-)  Studies have also shown that dark chocolate, perhaps due to its increased fiber content, makes you feel more \"filled up\", giving you more of a feeling of satiety compared with eating milk chocolate.<br /><br />At the time of this review's writing, Amazon had not yet priced this chocolate. But even if it was priced higher than other dark chocolates offered by the larger candy factories, I would still buy this because I believe in Newman's cause and charities.  I also love dark chocolate that is combined with nuts and/or berries, such as the Chocolove dark chocolates, and I hope that the \"Newman's\" dark chocolates line also eventually includes those.<br /><br />I love dark chocolates with cocoa content that goes to 77% and beyond, but these are not as sweet and have a subtle bitterness compared to dark chocolates with lower cocoa content.  The 54% cocoa content of this Newman's bar strikes a happy balance of sweetness that will appeal to those who are more accustomed to milk chocolate's sweetness.  This chocolate is not as sweet as some of the other 54-55% cocoa dark chocolates out there because many dark chocolates add higher amounts of extra sugar to their bars.  The flavor of this chocolate is nice, but with a slightly fibrous texture; just don't expect it to be as sweet as some of the more-sweetened dark chocolates on the market or else you may think that this tastes a bit bland compared to them.  Likewise, some people think that heavily-salted food tastes better than lightly-salted food.  The \"evaporated cane juice\" used as a sweetener in this chocolate is a healthier alternative than the processed sugar that is included in many chocolate bars (including the Belgium-made Chocolove bars that I love).  Both refined sugar and cane juice come from sugar cane, but cane juice is less processed and retains more nutrients.  So enjoy this smooth rich dark chocolate \"health food\" guilt-free, but in moderation.  I certainly will enjoy eating the rest of this chocolate bar while watching my DVD of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019UGYK0\">Cool Hand Luke (Deluxe Edition)</a>\n",

      "Like most health-conscious people, I appreciate the idea of organic food, and Paul Newman's Own is one of the most respected brands on the market. That's why I wanted to try this chocolate bar.<br /><br />I'm not a big \"chocoholic,\" but I do enjoy a taste of decadence on occasion, and this was one of those occasions.<br /><br />To make a long story short, I tried it and liked it, but it didn't taste nearly as good as Lady Godiva or even my old cheapie \"standby\" Hershey bar.<br /><br />Sure, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002NHYQAS\">Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate Bar, 2.25-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)</a> is  flavorful, but to my taste buds it seemed a little harsh... Oh, how do I describe it? I guess what I'm trying to say is that the texture wasn't creamy enough.<br /><br />In all fairness, I must confess that I often enjoy chocolate while drinking green tea; you know, a generous chunk of chocolate romancing my palate, followed by a sip of hot tea to mellow and enhance the taste sensation. Well, that proved to be what did it for me. Yes, I loooved it when savored in that manner<br /><br />I shared it with a friend who is more of a connoisseur than I am, and he loved it...straight from the stylish, golden wrapper.<br /><br />Another drawback for me is the expensive price. This 2.25-oz. size isn't available yet, but I found Newman's other same-size bars on Amazon for $26.88 per box of twelve. That works out to about $2.50 per candy bar (plus postage). Ouch!<br /><br />Needless to say, I would rather spend my hard-earned money another way. Sorry, Paul. I dearly love you and enjoyed many hours of quality movie time with you, but I'll stick to buying your salad dressings. Meanwhile, I'll get my chocolate kicks from my old friend, Mr. Hershey. Even Lady Godiva is out of my budget.<br /><br />With the small amount of chocolate I digest, it's not going to kill me. :-)<br /><br />Reviewed by Betty Dravis, February 24, 2011<br />Author of \"Dream Reachers\" (with Chase Von) and other books\n",

      "Some might argue that, just as there's no such thing as bad sex, there's no such thing as bad chocolate. (Even the worst of the latter I've ever consumed - in Leningrad, Russia in 1984 - was still edible. My history with the former we needn't discuss.)<br /><br />So, here we have NEWMAN'S OWN ORGANICS DARK CHOCOLATE (NOODC). Mind you, it doesn't contain such poncy embellishments such as almonds, macadamia nuts, cherries, pomegranate, mint chips, bacon shreds, rice krispies, orange peel, caramel filling, peanut butter, raisins, walnut pieces, toffee crunch, coconut, red pepper, coffee beans, cranberries, blueberries, white chocolate chunks, or the kitchen sink. It's just 100% chocolate, i.e. evaporated cane juice, chocolate liquor, cocoa butter, soy lecithin, and vanilla - all organic, of course. (It must be pointed out, however, that vanilla is used by chocolate makers to mask the flavor of imperfectly roasted cocoa beans. Hmm.)<br /><br />At 54% cocoa, NOODC isn't particularly elevated on that scale. Who in a chocolate company determines the what and why of an optimum concentration, I wonder? Probably the (cocoa) bean counters, I imagine.<br /><br />Because I have a taste disorder described more fully in my review of the book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0618861882\">Remembering Smell: A Memoir of Losing--and Discovering--the Primal Sense</a>, I can't judge the sweetness of this candy, but only the chocolate flavor and the \"mouth feel.\" Both are pretty much average and acceptable. Is it better than one of my favorite brands, a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004CH40HQ\">Cadbury Royal Dark Chocolate Bar, 3.5 oz, 24 count</a> bar? Uh ... no. But, it's infinitely better than that Commie chocolate eaten back in the nostalgic good old days of the Cold War! I mean, without any of the added embellishments mentioned above, a plain chocolate bar has to work overtime to stand out from the rest of that genre on the shelf.<br /><br />Actually, I was more interested in the subtleties of the label. Paul himself is pictured with Nell, his daughter by Joanne Woodward. Nell started the Organics Division of Newman's Own in 1993, and remained at its head when it chipped-off the old block in 2001. Dad still lent his support, though, before he died. I gather it's Nell`s leadership and participation that's inferred in the confectionary's subtitle, \"The Second Generation.\"<br /><br />Again, according to the labeling, the cocoa has been certified by the \"Rainforest Alliance.\" Perhaps I'm being cynical, but it makes me wonder how much Nell's company tips this outfit for the granting of its certification, however legitimate such a ritual blessing may be. Similarly, there's the notation \"Certified Organic by Oregon Tilth\" - whatever a \"Tilth\" is.<br /><br />Also, there's the usual CYA disclaimer: \"Manufactured on equipment that may process products containing peanuts, other nuts, milk powder, wheat soy, and egg.\" The potential hazards for allergy sufferers aside, how might those possible contaminants affect the organic quality of NOODC if they themselves aren't organic? Inquiring minds want to know. (Perhaps the \"USDA Organic\" sticker carries implications here. I'll certainly sleep better at night knowing the guv'mint is involved.)<br /><br />And the fact that a 1 bar serving size contains only 5 mg of sodium means that my wife could chow down the whole thing - minus the single bite I was tossed - without fear of elevating her already borderline-high blood pressure. After all, dark chocolate is reportedly a health food.<br /><br />Would I buy NOODC on at the local chain supermarket without it being at a bargain, club price? Probably not. I've never been convinced that \"organic\" isn't mostly a marketing ploy to raise the sticker, and NOODC at full price doesn't give more satisfaction than a less expensive bar laden with assorted impurities, toxins, and carcinogens. And both go down equally well with a glass of cold, non-fat moo.\n",

      "I love the \"Newman's Own\" line of products, but this chocolate is not my favorite. I think if you like milk chocolate you will probably like this.  I like the 70% cacao version better but even it has a bit of a waxy taste and doesn't give you the mouth feel of truly great chocolate. While I like the 70% better, I set out the 54% next to the 70% Newman's Own and 2 people preferred the 54% - one of those 2 I consider a chocolate lover.  While I won't buy more of this, don't get me wrong.

Some are too hard, some are too \"dry,\" some are too plain. Without a doubt, Blue Diamond produces the best-tasting almonds. I have had many different brands of almonds and if you are eating them out of the bag (IE, not cooking with them or mixing them with something), quality can go a long way.

Some of these are hit and miss with me. Some of the flavors are \"too\" bold, and some taste great the first few almonds, but quickly overwhelm you. Since my favorite Blue Diamond product is <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZSX4D2\">Blue Diamond Almonds Roasted Salted, 6-Ounce Tins (Pack of 12)</a>, I thought I would give these a try.  I have been disappointed with other products within their Bold line, but these aren't too bad.<br /><br />You can definitely taste the salt and vinegar, and it's pretty much the same amount of flavor you would find with Salt and Vinegar potato chips.  Normally, I can eat half a can of Blue Diamond almonds in one sitting, however the strong flavor of the vinegar overwhelms me a bit and I can usually only eat half a serving of these at once.  If you're a big Salt and Vinegar fan however, these shouldn't be a problem.  While the Salt and Vinegar Almonds aren't my favorite in the Bold line, I do like them much better than the other varieties, and will probably get them again.  If you've never tried them before, you may want to start with purchasing just one can rather than 12.\n",

      "I'll start off by noting that I love almonds, I eat almonds every day, and I particularly love Blue Diamond almonds. The most important qualities of almonds, for me, are freshness, quality, and careful roasting. Blue Diamond almonds get 5 stars on all those parameters.<br /><br />And I've tried all their flavors, especially their \"BOLD\" line. Alas, their definition of \"BOLD\" is apparently \"a little too spicy for kids.\" This flavor is okay, as a change of pace, but doesn't exactly set my taste buds a-\"blazin'.\" It doesn't taste like Buffalo wings -- it's too sweet and not vinegary enough. And it's definitely not spicy enough. I realize that real Buffalo wing spice can be brutal, and might not suit a mass-market snacking product. But really, they haven't even tried here. There's not even a hint of Tabasco, for example.<br /><br />As I said, this is a pleasant enough flavor, especially if you need a little change from, say, my favorite, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ4QJK\">Jalapeno Smokehouse</a>. But it doesn't taste much like anything in particular. They could have called it \"BOLD Generic Faux-Spicy Snack to be Eaten Brainlessly While Watching the Game\" flavor and it would have been more accurate.\n",

Others have pointed out the origins of the tea used in US brands, which makes it easy to see why we, as a people, don't drink hot tea.<br /><br />PG Tips is wonderful tea.

I bought some to try, because I am a tea \"whore.\" I always have upward of two dozen varieties of tea in the house at any given time--a situation that my then-coffee-addicted, then-boyfriend Tim found ridiculous.<br /><br />As soon as Tim tried PG Tips, all that changed.<br /><br />I now subscribe to recieve two extra-large boxes of PG Tips every few months.

      "Whether you like goat milk or cow milk is a matter of taste (I somewhat prefer cow milk in a carton over  goat milk made by adding water to  this powder).<br /><br /> However, there is a strong reason for preferring goat milk. Namely that it appears healthier for you and your children. This is that goat milk in the human study does not produce bovine caso-morphin-7 (BCM-7). This  peptide is produced by digestion of all of the cow milk available in the US. It is not produced by goat milk (or human milk).<br /><br /> There are a number of conditions for which bovine casomorphin-7  seems to play a role, including atherosclerosis (and hence heart disease and strokes), Type 1 diabetes, schizophrenia, autism, milk intolerance (not due to lactose intolerance) and sudden infant death syndrome.<br /><br /> The source for the above information is Woodford's recent book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1603581022\">Devil in the Milk: Illness, Health and the Politics of A1 and A2 Milk</a>.  Amazon lets you read significant fractions by searching with the keywords for what interests you, although I suggest buying the book and reading the full evidence.<br /><br /> While the milk of not all cows produce BCM-7 when digested, in the US milk free from these problems can not be bought(such milk can be bought in New Zealand and Australia). Thus, for those that wish to protect themselves and their children, the alternatives are to avoid cow milk (substituting something else, such as breast milk for babies), or use goat milk. Fortunately, calcium or other nutrients in milk can be obtained from foods other than milk. If we wish to consume milk, goat milk is the most available alternative for most outside of New Zealand and Australia.<br /><br /> However, goat milk is available in only a few stores, and these may not be near you. In these cases, a powdered goat milk, or a canned goat milk may be the healthy alternative. Powdered is cheaper than canned. If you do not anticipate using large amounts, having it in these 4 ounce packages will reduce the risk of the powder going bad before being used.\n",

      "To say I am no expert on tea is ...well... the truth. My earlier experience with tea was the occassional cup at a Chinese restaurant,or the cup loaded with honey for a sore throat. For me it was coffee, coffee, and more coffee.<br /><br />However,hearing so much about the benefits of green tea,I picked out a box of it at the store and put it up on my shelf.It just sat there. Then disaster struck - I was out of coffee! I remembered the green tea on the shelf and thought what the heck, maybe it will hold me over till I get to the store. I liked it! It gave me an afternoon pick-me-up that I wasn't expecting and even thought it tasted pretty good as well. I don't remember what kind it was as I have been through several boxes of green, various brand and flavors of the tea since then. Then I hit on:<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BM68QG\">Good Earth Tea Green Tea, Lemongrass, 25-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> -see my review for details of the Lemongrass - I loved it. It was the best I tried. Naturally I found the best deal here at Amazon.<br /><br />Next I wanted to try other flavors. This Orange flavored sounded pretty good. It has the added benefits of super anitoxidant(70% more than Good Earth's standard green tea) Japanese teas matcha and sencha. I found both the aroma and taste much lighter than the Lemongrass. The Orange gives just a hint of it's flavor. Other reviewers felt otherwise, so I would suggest to try one box first and if you like it go for this multi-pack. I do agree though that it's great for what ails ya. It's definitly one I would drink for anything from colds and sore-throats to aches and pains of all sorts. I also read that the matcha leaf helps to cleanse the body of toxins.<br /><br />This blend brews up an appealing golden shade. It gives me a renewed and refreshed feel but I also found it to be more calming than the Lemongrass which gave me quite an energy boost.It also doesn't seem to be dehydrating -as coffee can be - with more health benefits.Although I personally prefered the taste of the Lemongrass - my only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 - I still like this one and it is nice to have a litle variety for different moods or needs. And I don't need to add anything.<br /><br />It is caffeinated, but comparably much less then coffee per serving. It may be served hot or as Iced Tea.<br /><br />From the box:<br />Ingredients: Sencha Green Tea,Orange Oil,Green Tea Extract,Natural Flavors,Matcha and Chamomile Flowers.<br /><br />Super Green Tea - 162 mg avg antioxidants per serving.<br />Good Earth Standard Green tea -108 mg avg antioxidants per serving<br /><br />So I still love that morning cup of Java, but now I look forward to my afternoon Green Tea as well.Now I would find it a disaster to be without that! I even took some with me on a recent road trip - just to be sure I had some wherever I went.<br /><br />Remember to breathe,eat healthy and...enjoy the holidays!....Laurie\n",

      "I've been enjoying black, green, and herbal teas for years. Normally I keep a good supply of both <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GG0BN4\">Bigelow English Teatime Tea, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GFYRM6\">Bigelow Decaffeinated Organic Green Tea, 40-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> in the pantry. Recently my wife was given a \"Variety Pack\" of Good Earth teas and this particular tea was included. I'm a morning coffee drinker but after my two cups of French pressed Colombian Joe to get the motor running I switch to tea; normally a cup or two of the aforementioned Bigelow English Breakfast tea and as the day progresses I like to decrease the caffeine intake so I switch over to the Bigelow Green which is a decaffeinated tea. However, as teas go, green tea is relatively low in caffeine so the idea of switching to a regular, caffeinated green tea, really didn't bother me. Anyway, as soon as I enjoyed my first cup of this particular tea I new I had to make room in the cupboard; at least until I finished my supply of the Bigelow green.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed and enjoyed about this tea was the wonderful bouquet like aroma. Just like with a fine red wine the initial aroma/bouquet is part of the experience of enjoying good wine and flavored hot beverages. After the delicious aroma test passed with flying colors it was not surprising that the taste test would be at least equally if not more satisfying. Indeed it tasted delicious.<br /><br />As with any good quality green tea the flavor was fresh, light, and a bit grassy or \"green\". I was previously not familiar with \"Matcha\" or \"Sencha\", two of the three flavor additions to this tea but thanks to the internet, information about darned near anything is always nearby. I'm not going to Wikipedia you about Matcha and Sencha but suffice it to say they are both other forms of Japanese green teas that do in fact pack a powerful additional punch of antioxidants genuinely verifying the company's advertisment of \"...more antioxidants\".<br /><br />Allegedly this tea has 70% more antioxidants than their \"Standard Green Tea\". This claim though, stretches the truth. Comparing the two products nutritional information: Good Earth's Super Green Tea has 162mg avg. antioxidants per serving whereas their Standard Green Tea has 108mg avg. per serving. According to my calculator that's 50% more (162/108 = 1.5) It annoys me when companies make misleading claims. In cases such as this though I find it simply hard to understand why they would stretch the truth. Based upon the product as it stands, they really don't need to inflate this percentage. The tea is delicious, it's got more antioxidants, why don't they print that or print that \"our Standard Green Tea has 67% fewer antioxidants than our Super Green Tea! LOL. Okay so that whole thing I wrote about the percentage of antioxidants is really pretty irrelevant, I know, but I had fun doing it. Sorry if I lost you, it's just all in good fun.<br /><br />The real FLAVOR FLASH in this Super Green Tea is the ORANGE. I think it's great. It tastes like they've added just the right amount of fresh orange zest to set this green tea apart from unflavored ones and it's a combination that works. And why shouldn't it? Citrus flavoring with tea is certainly nothing new.<br /><br />Now the claim that follows is my own and it is supported by the following facts and data: At the time of this writing there were eleven customer reviews on Amazon's Web site for this product. Ten of those reviews were positive (i.e. 4 or 5 stars) and one was neutral (3 stars). By my calculator that means that 91.7& (rounded) of the population really like this tea and NOBODY dislikes it. Based upon the facts and data I think it's safe to buy some for yourself. But, you may well be an outlier and not like it at all so, to be really safe and smart, if you haven't already tried it, buy a box at your local grocery store. If you like it come back to Amazon and get in on their Subscribe and Save Program.<br /><br />I like buying Bigelow brand teas primarily because I like their flavor and believe they use fresh high quality teas, but also, and nearly equally as important, is because of how they are packaged; that is each tea bag is individually packaged in a fully sealed foil-like pouch. While this certainly adds to the cost it also helps assure freshness is maintained; an absolutely essential element in ensuring a good cup of tea. This variety of Good Earth tea is packaged in the same, high quality, freshness maintaining manner.<br /><br />Just a final general note on brewing green tea: Just as you would brew any other kind of tea, whether you have bagged tea or loose green tea, one thing to watch out for: Don't use fully boiling water. Green tea is more delicate than black, so it's best to keep the water a little cooler. Brewing when your water is just about to hit the boil is ideal.<br /><br />Bon appetit!\n",

      "Anything that claims to be \"dark chocolate\" flavored immediately has my attention, as I'm a true chocoholic with a preference for the intense bittersweet flavor of a good dark chocolate.  Unfortunately, these cocoa-dipped almonds don't deliver on the promise of their name, although they are indeed a good, nutritious (but high fat) snack with a hint of sweetness and chocolate flavor.  Not surprisingly, the predominant flavor is almond; the nutty, skin-on taste overwhelms the chocolate dusting.  Nut lovers will likely appreciate the twist on an old favorite since the cocoa does indeed bring out the almond flavor.  The almonds are crunchy and roasted to perfection, with few or no overdone brown interiors.<br /><br />Diabetics and others who watch their sugar intake will be pleased to learn that this snack contains only 1 gram of sugar per 1/4 cup serving because of the addition of sucralose, an artificial sweeteners better known commercially as Splenda.  Dieters, however, will want to be careful with the 13 grams of fat in that same size serving.<br /><br />In general, I like Emerald nut products, but this one disappointed me, mostly because I found the chocolate flavor lacking and because I try to avoid artificial sweeteners.

This maple nectar is the best of both: rich, meady flavor AND the perfect degree of refinement. A perfect blend. Go for it.\n",

      "These Walker's Shortbread Fingers in single serving packs of two are fabulous!!  Here's why:<br /><br />1)  Yes, as everyone says, these Walker cookies are exceptional.  You may think it's all just buzz, but if you haven't tried them, don't judge us as silly until you do (!).<br /><br />2)  But what happens if you open a box -- you finish it, right!  BAD.  These little suckers aren't the greatest thing for you, to put it mildly.<br /><br />3)  Answer:  single serving packaging!!  It really works.  My husband is addicted to these cookies.  I'd always have a box on hand in case of unexpected guests -- at least, I'd think I had one, but the box would usually have disappeared unexpectedly whenever I went to look for it.  True confessions:  I love them too and was occasionally looking to sneak some for myself!  So having them around just in case was a bad, BAD idea.  But a case full of packs with 2 cookies each is ideal.  Two seems to satisfy my husband's craving -- he almost never takes more than one packet.  And I open a packet occasionally and make 2 cookies last 2 days, instead of a whole box lasting almost forever and my worrying that they'd go stale or attract ants.<br /><br />Bonus:  they're easily packable!  When my husband's expecting an exceptionally tough day at work, I'll usually sneak a pack into his lunch if he hasn't already appropriated one for himself.<br /><br />And when he's especially wiped out at the end of an unusually demanding day, a pack of these really seems to perk him up and help him muster strength for tomorrow.  He brings it upstairs while he's watching TV and waits a while before opening the bag and savoring his treasure.  Whether for lunch or after dinner, the gleam in his eye as he talks about how wonderful it is to have a treat when he's so stressed means a lot to me, especially when I know he's only eating in moderation instead of wolfing down ten or twenty servings at a time.  A case of 24 2-packs (that's how many were in our case in the product <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GCVLX6\">Walkers Shortbread Fingers, 2-Count Cookies Packages (Pack of 24)</a>, although this one here has 12 2-packs) has lasted us 3 months already -- a pleasant surprise, given that there are 2 addicts in the house.  :  So our portion-control strategy is working!!!<br /><br />And yes, when we had guests who chose after-dinner tea, these were just the right thing to bring out with it, and I didn't mind opening multiple packs at once and putting the cookies together on 1 plate for serving, knowing that I wasn't either spoiling an entire box, or promoting too rapid consumption of it, just by providing our guests with a few.<br /><br />[I wish two other treasures came in single-serving packets:  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FSK58S\">LU Herbes De Provence Flatbread Crackers, 4.25-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000K8WI1Q\">Mary's Gone Crackers, Caraway, 6.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>!!]<br /><br />STRONGLY RECOMMENDED!!\n",

      "Ever since I moved to Chesapeake, Virginia, over twenty-three years ago, I have suffered from chronic sinusitis.  Therefore, I drink a lot of caffeine-free herbal tea with honey and lemon in order to relieve my sinus congestion in the evenings before going to bed.  [I also wash out my sinus cavities with Alkalol (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003YFG0M0\">Alkalol - A Natural Soothing Nasal Wash, Mucus Solvent and Cleaner Kit -  with Cup, 16-Ounce</a>).]  Herbal tea is a nice indulgence, especially in the cold winter months.  Well, it may be late April now but, with the temperatures in the forties, it still feels like winter to me and I am slightly congested.<br /><br />  I decided tonight would be appropriate for brewing a packet of the Gold Kili All Natural Instant Ginger and Lemon Beverage Mix that the Amazon Vine Program sent me for review.  I heated water in a tea pot until it began boiling and whistling.  I poured the contents of the tea packet into a coffee mug and added two squirts of lemon juice and approximately one tablespoon of honey (I love honey).  Then I added 250 ml (one cup) of boiling water, stirred vigorously with a spoon and gently sipped, being careful not to burn my lips.<br /><br />  I loved the aroma of the ginger.  However, it's strong, spicy taste made me cough a few times until I grew accustomed to it.  The ginger burned my throat, but it was a soothing burn like menthol cough drops.  The ginger tea also reminded me of horseradish, which often burns my throat while clearing my nostrils of congestion.  The honey I added made this tea very sweet.  Furthermore, I sipped it while watching a classic horror film, \"The Dorm that Dripped Blood.\"  The tea had a calming affect on my nerves.  After all, watching someone in a darkened stairwell get clubbed to death with a nail-spiked baseball bat can be unsettling.<br /><br />  When I dine at Panera, I sprinkle ginger and cinnamon powder into my coffee.  These are two healthy spices, especially ginger.  Ginger relieves indigestion; this is why it is often used during the holidays when celebrants overeat.  It also has anti-viral properties that help fight infections and relieve congestion.  It also relieves the symptoms of osteoarthritis.  Now I know firsthand that drinking ginger tea can also relieve the symptoms of chronic sinusitis.<br /><br />  I highly recommend the Gold Kili All Natural Instant Ginger and Lemon Beverage Mix for health-conscious people who love drinking herbal teas.  I recommend it for those, like myself, who suffer from chronic sinusitis.  I definitely plan to look for this product, or one similar to it, the next time I am grocery shopping.  I wish I had received an entire box for review instead of one packet.  I have friends at work who would love to try this product.  Like I said earlier, I have suffered with allergy problems since I first moved to Chesapeake and there are thousands like me in the Tidewater area.  Furthermore, I would like to know how this ginger tea would taste as an ice-cold beverage but it would probably lose some of its decongestant properties.<br /><br />Joseph B. Hoyos\n",

Just enough sweetness without over doing it.  No bitter after taste.  Must be the ginger, but there is a definite lingering of sheer hotness (like a mild cayenne pepper) on the tongue -  that lingers for awhile. :)<br /><br />The lemon is not bitter, caustic tasting or over powering -- just very smooth.  No puckering-up here. :)<br /><br />*I'm thinking this may be just the caffeine free \"pick-me-up\" I need around 2pm, to get me through the day.*<br /><br />Does Gold Kili All Natural Instant Ginger & Lemon sound like your kind of Beverage Mix?

I usually add lemon juice to my Ginger Honey Crystals anyways...why not try a brand that has it included?  You can drink it either hot or cold - I added hot water to mine, as I like ginger tea.  To my dismay, the Kili Ginger Lemon Bev was not very good.  The ginger has a very light kick, and wasn't as spicy as most ginger teas.  The lemon flavor was overpowering.  They should rename this the Lemon & Ginger Bev mix, as that's what it tasted like to me.  Even after adding a little milk and honey to it, it still didn't have a good flavor.  If you like the Ginger Honey Crystals, you probably won't like the Gold Kili brand...it's not particularly gingery and the lemon is too strong.  You're better off adjusting the lemon and honey ratio on your own.\n",

If so, there is a good chance that you'll like Gold Kili's Ginger & Lemon drink mix.<br /><br />This is a ginger, lemon & honey drink mix.  It is spicy.  It has honey but is not syrupy sweet.  The ginger is much more predominant than the lemon.  As a stand alone in the recommended 8.45oz of hot water, the drink was too ginger/spicy for me (I like spicy).  After I added milk, the drink became pretty good.  However, the mix is strong enough to hold up to more water + milk.<br /><br />This drink mix is not something that I would reach for as a daily drink (like afternoon tea); however, I think it would be very soothing as a hot drink when I'm not feeling 100%.<br /><br />This ginger/lemon drink has a unique taste.  It is interesting & worth a shot if you like both ginger & spicy drinks.\n",

      "Except for a cold bottle of high-quality ginger ale, I don't often reach for ginger drinks unless for medicinal purposes. With that mindset, I tried Gold Kili's Instant Ginger Lemon Beverage Mix and almost wished I had saved the experience for the next time I'm stricken with a cold or flu.<br /><br />There's plenty of ginger spice here. And lemon...and an aftertaste that wasn't pleasant. Whether you call it `spicy' or `tangy' or `zesty', the drink is cloyingly gingered. I happen to like that when I'm drinking <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0048KFVMU\">Reed'S Ginger Beer Extra Ginger Brew</a> on a hot, summer day. However, I can't recommend Gold Kili's Instant Ginger Lemon Beverage Mix unless you are already sick and in need of ginger to soothe your condition.<br /><br />I tested and reviewed this drink as part of Amazon's Vine program, receiving one packet for free. Too bad they didn't send a couple more. I wanted to share a cup with a couple of my foodie friends to hear their take.

A head cold. Runny nose. Head congestion. The works. So, I tried Gold Kili again, taking my own advice from the initial review.

There was no steeping involved:  the instructions simply stated to add boiling water and then to serve immediately.  I did like the ginger flavor, but I think it was the lemon that gave this product and odd taste, sort of syrup-y and medicinal.<br /><br />In the end, as a hot beverage, this was just okay--drinkable, but that's about it.

      "This tea reminds me of similar blends I used to get in Chinatown.  They are great for cold and flu season.  I use ginger lemon herbal tea when my throat is sore.  This was a good drink, it dissolved into hot water easily.  There were no ingredients listed on the pack, but it was sweetened and that tasted non-artificial.  I am not sure what \"Honey (Fructose, Glucose and Sucrose)\"  is because it seems to be four things, but maybe that is one of those lost in translation things.  I do like this drink and would buy something similar if I wanted something pre-sweetened.  I am not sure about the calorie content in this tea because I received one bag to sample and not a box, which would have had a nutritional guide on it.  It tastes as good as Stash's <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQG87Q\">Stash Premium Lemon Ginger Herbal Tea, Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>, which I normally drink for my throat.  The ginger is pretty strong with the lemon adding just the right amount of sour.  I am not really sure why this tea is getting such low marks, I liked it a lot.  I wish I had more than one bag to sample.  I would have loved to had tried this with matcha or in a recipe of some kind.  I should note I had this hot, I didn't know you could serve it cold.  I don't have any more bags to try that, but would like to.<br /><br />Overall, if you are a ginger fan, you'll love this.  If you don't like strong ginger, you should probably buy a more mild tisane.  I would say the Stash tea above, though it does have soy in it.  I tend to prefer this tea over that because it doesn't have soy in it.  I find most Yogi tea to be very mild on the ginger side but it seems a lot of people like them.  I would prefer a real ginger taste and maybe people aren't used to real ginger.  It's almost a mediation type of drink, used to ease stomach problems and for all around well being.  I feel the difference after I drink a tisane like this or eat ginger root.  It's energizing.  I do think, however and this is a minor thing, that any chemical taste people are getting is probably from the \"Honey (Fructose, Glucose and Sucrose)\", whatever that is and not the lemon itself.  It's probably an aftertaste from the sweetener.  I wish they sold a non-sweetened version of this so I could compare.\n",

      "I looked at the other reviews for this drink, noticed that many said the ginger was way strong. I thought \"Well, I really like ginger, so it'll be ok.\" But, really, it's STRONG. Mixing with the instructed 240ml (1 cup) of water leaves a very gingery drink. However, diluting it with about another half-cup of water brought the ginger down to a nice level. At this point it was just SWEET, like ginger tea with 2 packets of Splenda. Way too sweet for me.<br />The lemon is of course overpowered by the ginger. This wouldn't really be a problem if it wasn't so sweet.<br /><br />The one thing I really did like was drinking it with a sore throat. Swollen, aching throat loves ginger, lemon, and hot beverages in general. The Gold Kili drink felt quite nice on my throat and I didn't mind the sweetness or strength of the ginger as much as I probably would normally.<br />Also, it takes a few sips to get used to the flavor. By the time I was almost finished it didn't seem nearly as strong.<br /><br />Coming upon a packet of this, I wouldn't turn it down, but I probably wouldn't buy it. I'd much rather just get tea, like <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQG87Q\">Stash Premium Lemon Ginger Herbal Tea</a>, and sweeten it with honey myself.\n",

I prefer the instant in this case because tea-bag varieties I've tried tend to lack flavor and be quite tame.

But this herbal root also gives you such a hot zing that you feel a little more awake along with bringing joy to your taste buds. That being said, my taste buds found the level of ginger in this beverage to be a little bit much. This would be great for the diehard ginger lover OR fantastic if mixed with fruit or other fruity herbs in hot water. This product could also add zing to your conventional iced tea in the summer. So I would recommend trying it. The fact that it is a powdered compounded product adds ease to mixing it for an instant cuppa lift!

      "I usually make my own ginger-lemon tea, most often to keep colds at bay (as per the recommendation of Kimberly Snyder in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0373892322\">The Beauty Detox Solution: Eat Your Way to Radiant Skin, Renewed Energy and the Body You've Always Wanted</a> (her immunity tea recipe is also available on her blog).<br /><br />I'm always looking for an on-the-go alternative to making the tea from scratch for the time when one is traveling and might not have the option of buying fresh ginger and fresh lemon, but at the time when one is more susceptible to a cold (lower immunity due to stress, jetlag, lack of sleep, etc.). Having to only add hot water definitely saves a lot of effort of tracking down the ingredients and time to actually peeling the ginger, squeezing the lemon, etc.<br /><br />I have tried the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002SWB73C\">Instant Ginger Honey Crystals Pack of 30 Bags - 18 g Sachets</a> and found those to be very heavy on the ginger. Comparatively, Gold Kili All Natural Instant Ginger & Lemon Beverage, which similarly comes packaged in a bag and needs to be mixed with water, doesn't taste overwhelmingly gingery.<br /><br />However, the Gold Kili product tastes incredibly sugary. It's the kind of drink that gets worse the more you try it. The first sip seems acceptable, the second seems iffy, and then before you know it, your body decided that it's a bit more sugar than you bargained for. I appreciate the fact that it's caffeine-free, but must it be overwhelmingly sweet to block the taste of ginger?\n",

      "I seldom give a one star review, usually trying to find something positive about any product, but with this one, I found it lousy.  As a ginger fan, I was eager to receive the packet and conduct a side by side tasting with the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002SWB73C\">Instant Ginger Honey Crystals Pack of 30 Bags - 18 g Sachets</a> and asked a friend from Jamaica to join me.  First of all, this product is tiny granules that are much darker than the Prince of Peace product.  When mixed with hot water, rather than being a lovely gold, it is a brown.  The first taste was awful and I mean really awful.  My friend added some sweetener to hers thinking it would be an improvement, but it was an unsuccessful attempt.  I felt the lemon flavor overwhelmed the ginger flavor, yet there was some heat from the ginger that tried to come forward.  The flavor was extremely unbalanced and tasted more like the taste of a lemon which has been cut and stored in the refrigerator, turning brown and developing a rancid flavor that creeps into the nose.  My friend held her nose and drank her half cup but I could not force mine down.  Instead, I gladly drank the other beverage.\n",

      "I love strong Ginger flavors but I recognice that most people will find this drink, intended to ve served hot, as a very strong Ginger experience & possibly too strong.  I only got one sachet tio try which wasn't really enough to judge the product by conpletely but I could easily see myself consuming this as a hot beverage during times when I didn't feel well or was queasy from the long baot ride back from Catalina.  The Ginger is bracingly strong when hot but lightly sweetened.  It reminded me a bit of the Trader Joe's Lemon Echinacea drink I mix with my Iced tea so I waited for it to cool down and mixed it  with 2 parts Iced tea and 1 part of the reminder of the sachet and allowed to cool.  Nowe THAT worked for me.  It has a strong Ginger aroma and adds a nice ZING to my iced tea.<br /><br />I'd like to have some of this on hand for when I next get the cold or flu because strong Ginger drinks do settle my stomach and sooth my congestion.  I just wish I had a few more servings to try in several ways so I could give this a proper review.<br /><br />I would say, if you liked the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004TPKAN4\">Newman's Own Organics Ginger Snaps, Family Recipe Cookies, 6.5-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a>, which are SUPER GINGER SNAPS, then you will probably enjoy this as both a hot drink and a either an iced drink by itself or mixed with your tea od choice.  There are no ugly aftertastes or icky sweetness to content with and it is an interesting, medicine-free method of treating a cold.  I can see myself keeping some on my shelf or just such occasion!\n",

      "I don't much care for this Stash Premium Loose Green Tea.  I'm no tea expert, but I've got several problems with it.  Flavor-wise, I find this tea to be bitter with a grassy taste (that's not a good flavor, to me).  Texture-wise, the tea \"leaves\" range from almost half-inch long thin shards of leaves down to 1/16th of an inch sized remnants (I've uploaded a picture so you can see for yourself).  The mishmash of textures makes it difficult to portion out the leaves and results in a lot of the small stuff making its way through the infuser of my <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010NR7C0\">Bodum YoYo Personal Tea Set with Infuser and 12-Ounce Glass</a> (admittedly, a finer meshed infuser might not have as much of an issue here).  Also, the wide range of textures indicates (to me) that these tea leaves might not necessarily have been chosen for inclusion.  Instead, it feels like they might just have been leftovers from other processes (that's merely my non-knowledgeable feelings and not based on any hard facts).  On a positive note, I will say that the steeped beverage does have a very nice yellowish green color.  Overall, though, I have to rate this tea at a not-very-good 2 stars out of 5.

Probably it will not seem that sweet if you eat a lot of sugars regularly.  It isn't a cloying, over-powering sweetness that comes with sugar laden, refined snacks.<br /><br />The texture of the manna all by itself is a bit pasty, like peanut-butter, only slightly more so.

The oil will separate, and the way to stir it back in is to warm the entire jar so it's all very soft, and then stir back in.<br /><br />I think it's delicious.  I like a bit spread like butter (warm slightly to spread) on a flax seed cookie I make. Sometimes I mix it into the batter of the flax seed cookie.<br />I like a dab on a sweet potato chip.<br /> It's a good 'candy' if you mix warmed manna well with a bit of ground flax seed, a few drops of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00142FP5I\">SweetLeaf Liquid Stevia, Chocolate 2 fl oz (60 ml)</a>, and cocoa powder- drop onto waxed paper, put in fridge for the manna to harden.

I had very disappointing luck with this one.  I  read the instructions and followed them clearly, paying particular attention to keeping the soil moist and warm and the light dim until germination.

Chipotle peppers are one of my favorites because they deliver just that, heat with a rich, smokey flavor that works well with many hearty dishes.  I usually buy chipotles whole as well as ground.  Although I have dozens of ground peppers in my cabinet, Chipotle, along with Cayenne and Ancho, are the hardest working spices in my kitchen.<br /><br />There are times when I prefer a pepper paste instead of a dried pepper.  I can make my own, but having it pre-made is a great convenience.  I have recently started using the Roland brand of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V76YOS\">Chipotle Peppers in Adobo Sauce</a> instead of my usual brand and I like them better.  I am now using this paste and I couldn't be happier with it.  I add it to soups, stews, chilies, anything that is thick and rich.  The paste blends with these types of dishes better than powders and imparts an unmistakable Chipotle flavor to everything that it touches.  The heat is just about right and a little goes a long way.  I plan on keeping several cans on hand at all times.\n",

      "I am posting this because unfortunately Amazon does not show the label, ingredients on many items.  Since you can not see it, many would assume that this is just dried fruit.  It is not.  It is fruit dried with sulpher.  For some this may not be an issue (but you should know that it is there nonetheless).  I have developed sulphur allergies over the years (you develop allergies via exposure) and with more and more mass produced bulk items containing sulphur, likely many more people will too.  I have had some pretty serious health consequences of same.<br />We can get these locally very inexpensively (I am in Hawaii) and would never purchase this particular brand because of the sulphur.  I did buy it once without thinking, and they tasted bitter, acrid, nowhere near as good as we get in local shops, health food stores.  I realize that tropical fruit is not easy to get everywhere, but there are good healthy alternatives.  Consider, for example: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HN5O3C\">Woodstock Farms Mango Slices, Unsulphured, 8.5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)</a><br />i was browsing here, hoping to get better prices (and access) on bulk dried fruit, but can see that the lack of labeling info is going to cause me a problem :(  I guess my only alternative until other customers specify what is on the label, is to buy things specifically labeled \"unsulphured\".<br />If you do not have allergiews or sulphur related health problems (yet) maybe consider comparing the 2.  Sulphured fruit is bitter, leaves a chemical aftertaste and is overdried making it taste a lot less fresh (which it generally is) and tougher.  In my experience, this particular product is the worst offender (at least that I have encountered).  It is heavvily sulphured and really tastes off.\n",

But to make a pitcher of lemonade (which is what I use it for most often), I had to use 60 drops, which got tedious.  So I decided to try this version, since it is twice as concentrated.  This has made it a lot more convenient for me, plus, with the 2-ounce bottle, I was always taken by surprise when it suddenly ran out.  With this three-pack, I know to order another box when I'm down to my last bottle.  Both versions are great, but based on those two advantages, I will probably buy this one from now on.<br /><br />In my experience, the conversion ratio for EZ-Sweetz versus sugar or Splenda in a recipe is not quite as described.  I've always had to use more Splenda than what its manufacturer says is the sugar equivalent, and with EZ-Sweetz, I have to use a little more than what they claim as the Splenda equivalent (I haven't noticed any problem with the claim of this EZ-Sweetz being twice as concentrated as the 2-ounce version; I use 30 drops now).  But still, it's such a huge savings of carbs (and even calories), it's a good product to get.<br /><br />Update 8/27/12 - The first several packages I got were very easy to dispense.  However, the past two packages I've purchased have required a much tighter squeeze to get them to drip.  If you only need one or two drops, it's not a big deal.  But when you're counting out 30 for a big pitcher of lemonade, it becomes downright *painful*.  I thought the first batch was a fluke (though it was all three bottles).  But now this batch (ordered more than a month later) is just as bad.  I've dropped my star rating as a result, and I'll be looking for different product to switch to.\n",

There wasn't even anything fancy about the packaging!<br /><br />edit: okay, these actually bother my stomach a little after one truffle. the package wasn't shipped with an ingredients list, and i had to go to the company site directly and find a well-hidden and hard to follow ingredients page to discover there's a lot of shady ingredients, including high fructose corn syrup. For $40 a box, I expect NO CORN SYRUP.

The website and packaging say nothing about this, so I wrote them an email asking where their product is manufactured. Here is the response in full:<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Thank you for your purchase and inquiry. We understand your concerns because<br />food item are very personal. If you can spear a few moments to read details<br />about our quality assurance, it would be appreciated.<br /><br />Our factory in China is HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point)<br />by US agency & BRC certified UK agency.

We hope we have assisted you correctly.<br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />Kind regards,<br /><br />Julie<br />Mrs Mays<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I've read other reviews criticizing over sweatshops, Communism, and carbon footprint. To briefly address these: There has been no evidence that Mrs. Mays keeps its workers in sweatshops; despite the Communism, I'm sure the individual citizens find these jobs valuable; and ships produce 1/10th the carbon per pound-mile of trucks, meaning a 5000 miles by ship is as bad as 500 miles by truck.<br /><br />I really like the snack and I'd give it five stars, but I'm subtracting one star: I think it is deceptive that it was so hard to find out the snack was made in China. I don't have a problem with the snack's origin, but Mrs. Mays should be more forthright with their customers and let them make the decision themselves. Granted, most of us Americans are primed to flip out at the latest Scare of the Week, but that should be our choice to make.<br /><br />Oh, and the snack itself? It is quite tasty, filling, and healthy. I will continue to purchase it.\n",

      "We breastfeed our month old boy, but since his bilirubin level was still high, doctors recommended to switch to formula for 48 hours. We started with Similac Advance (Shield Plus) which we still had from hospital. First 24 hours were wonderful in terms of pooping, then we decided to switch to Similac Organic for known reasons, but during the first 32-Ounce Bottle I began to notice that his stool was getting harder, and eventually he stopped pooing (actually he produced two stone-ball like poops) and had a hard time for another 24 hours. Breast milk and Similac advance tested similarly sweet, but Similac Organic was much much less sweet. I made a research on the internet and I found the following that may help you to understand the cause of constipation: (http://www.drhull.com/EncyMaster/C/constipation_infant.html)<br /><br />Constipation means infrequent, hard stools. It does not mean grunting or straining, although your baby may certainly exhibit these behaviors when having a bowel movement. So the first question to ask is, \"Is my child really constipated?\"<br /><br />Next, consider why true constipation - excessively hard, dry stools - arises. The normal function of the colon is to remove water from the stool. Otherwise we would rapidly dehydrate and die. That is why severe diarrhea is dangerous - the stool is moving through the colon and being expelled from the body so fast, there is no time to properly reabsorb the stool water back into the bloodstream.<br /><br />Conversely, if the fecal material remains in the colon too long, the water removal process may extract too much of the fecal water and leave the stool mass excessively dry and hard. It is just that simple.<br /><br />So constipation arises when feces remain in the colon too long because:<br /><br />  * the colon is naturally sluggish (has decreased \"motility,\" we say)<br />  * a low residue diet produces insufficient stimulation to the colon to trigger its normal propulsive activity and clear out the feces<br />  * a combination of the above two factors<br />  * there is obstruction of the lower GI tract<br />  o functional neurologic - the lower rectum and anus cannot properly relax to allow evacuation - Hirschprung disease<br />  o functional anatomic - anal-rectal positioning doesn't allow easy evacuation<br />  o mechanical - a tumor physically blocks stool passage<br /><br />Breast fed babies are essentially never truly constipated. This is because breast milk is such a low residue diet. Almost all of the milk is absorbed by the baby and used. The stools consist of a small amount of unabsorbed protein curds and a large amount of bowel secretions, chiefly mucus. And of course a lot of noisy gas. But these infrequent stools do not indicate constipation - just infrequent stools.<br /><br />Later, when breast feeding infants start solids, they technically can become constipated, but it is unusual in my experience. It is not until the child is pretty much on solids and especially when weaned to whole cow milk that constipation is much of an issue. By then we are really discussing toddlers.<br /><br />Breast fed infants do tend to save up after the first few months and poop less often. This worries some parents. Despite reassurances to the contrary, some folks just have to see a poop every day from their little darling to be happy and fulfilled. Go figure. They forget that stool can stay in the colon for a very, very long time and it will not hurt anything.<br /><br />When the stool hoarding breast feeder does finally get ready to go, another problem comes to the fore: grunting and straining. When the baby's rectum forms in utero, it is in a state of permanent contraction for nigh onto nine months. The baby does not pass the meconium (fetal stool) in utero until perhaps right at the end of gestation right before, during or after delivery. Until the baby is several months old, and has passed and been stretched by quite a few bowel movements, the rectum and particularly the anus may be quite tight and resist easy dilation to allow the stool to pass. Because the baby has weak, flabby abdominal musculature (that is why his little tummy is so poochy), he must push against this tight anal spincter with his diaphragm. Just as Mom pushed during delivery, and with seemingly equal discomfort. Hence the grunting and red-faced straining.<br /><br />  The other major problem of both breast or bottle fed newborns which creates this sort of straining is dyschezia, or uncoordinated stooling.<br /><br />The cure for the problem of a tight anus is pretty simple: a gentle rectal exam with a well-lubricated pinky finger by the doctor (which should be done on all babies with stooling troubles anyway to rule out a physical obstruction) will be both diagnostic and curative. If one such gentle dilation doesn't do the trick, I have Mom bring the baby back in a week and repeat the procedure. The anal spincter is stretched, and pretty soon, no more terrible straining.<br />Top<br /><br />Bottle fed infants are \"a whole 'nother story.\" Infant formulas are not nearly as well digested as breast milk, and leave quite a bit more residue in the colon. (The exception to this rule in my mind is the new Similac® that really does seem to leave the stools about the same consistency as breast milk.) So true constipation in bottle fed infants is much more common; my feeling is that soy formulas are even worse than cow milk based formulas in this regard.<br /><br />The young infant's colon is simply not designed for all the residue and stool bulk. The residue builds up, is dried too much, and becomes hard, pebbly stool. It is naturally difficult and uncomfortable for the baby to pass.<br /><br />The addition of cereal to the diet only compounds whatever problems already exist. Cereal + milk = concrete. Cereal in the formula bottle seems to be especially bad, probably because parents don't realise just how much cereal the baby is getting.<br />Top<br /><br />Treatment of constipation mainly involves common sense diet modifications and sometimes medication:<br /><br />  * Again, as with breast fed babies, a search for the cause of the constipation and gentle rectal exam can work wonders.<br />  * I use a lot of Karo® corn syrup for bottle feeders with constipation. It is my first choice recomendation; it almost always works if used properly. Unfortunately, many doctors and nurses don't use it properly, get poor results, and don't recommend it as often as they should. I start with two measuring teaspoons in every formula bottle, regardless of size, and adjust the dose up or down depending on how things are going. Usually, the baby can be weaned off the Karo pretty soon, but may need to stay on it periodically for the first few months of life. It is very important to put the corn syrup in the formula and not give it in between in water. The excess corn syrup does not get digested very well - the baby is already digesting all the sugar he can from the formula. The excess sugar passes down to the colon and produces a sugar diarrhea similar to sorbitol (as below, prunes, apple juice).<br /><br />  Before scolding me about \"the risk of botulism\" from corn syrup, please see:<br /><br />  Clinical Pediatric Emergency Medicine, Volume 4,Number 3,September 2003: \"Pediatric neurologic potpourri: cases to remember\"<br /><br />  \"In the past, C. botulinum was also found in corn syrup, but this is no longer a risk factor for infant botulism because of a recent change in the processing formula.\"<br /><br />  For the complete source of statement, see: Olsen SJ, Swerdlow DL. Risk of infant botulism from corn syrup. In reply. Pediatr Infect Dis J 2000;19:584-5.<br /><br />  * Certain fruits and juices - for example prunes, apple juice, apricots - are rich in sorbitol, a nondigestible sugar that passes through the body to the colon and causes water to be retained or drawn into the stool mass. They can be increased in the diet to loosen the stool and relieve or prevent constipation.<br />  * Lactulose is a non-absorbable sugar product that is processed by colon bacteria to produce an inflow of water into the stool mass. We use it a lot - it seems to be a favorite of our local pediatric gastroenterologists. The dose is adjusted up or down according to respose. Side effects are usually not serious but can include cramping or diarrhea - obviously, stop the medicine and call your doctor if these occur.<br />  * Glycerine suppositories are helpful to relieve your child if there is some hard stool that just won't come out easily. The suppository melts in the heat of the rectum and lubricates the stool. Glycerine also has a mild effect of attracting water into the stool, which softens it. The act of insertion also serves to stimulate the rectum and anus to initiate the defecation reflex. (Glycerine is completely safe - it is a food, found in candy, not a drug.)<br />  * Fiber containing foods are helpful for older children and adults, but are not really of much use in the treatment of young infant constipation, for dietary reasons: babies just don't eat a lot of fiber. (I believe ISoyalac®, which was a high fiber soy formula, has been discontinued. It was never very available any place I practiced, anyway.)<br /><br />Top<br /><br />Myths and misconceptions concerning infant constipation:<br /><br />  * Iron in the formula causes constipation. No way. I can understand lay people thinking this to be the case because when adults take iron preparations (in large doses) they may become constipated. But the tiny amount present in infant formula is not nearly enough to cause any problems.<br /><br />  The irritating thing to me is to hear doctors and nurses who should know better repeating this nonsense and switching the infants to the less healthy low- or no-iron formulas.<br /><br />  * Increasing water in the diet is commonly recommended; it makes very little sense and demonstrates a failure to reflect on the basic physiologic cause of the overdry stool. The problem is too little water retention in the stool, not too little water in the body! Unless there is increased fiber or some chemical substance such as a sugar (Karo®, lactulose) to retain the water in the stool, excess water will simply wind up in the diaper as urine.<br /><br />Top\n",

      "Most people know that cats can be finicky eaters.  They devour some food and simply walk away from others.  I guess that is one trait that I find most interesting about our three Bengal cats.  They can eat like horses and yet are rather picky about what foods they will eat.  They all like tuna, ham, and even beg for a potato chip from time to time, yet they don't seem to care for turkey and even some types of cheese.  My family and I love our cats very much, and we are concerned about their health and want to feed them nutritious food.  Since all of our Bengals love chicken, I was delighted to recently have the opportunity to try the new Petite Cuisine Chinese Chicken and Chicken Pot Pie Variety Pack.<br /><br />We received a 24 pack, which includes 6 individual boxes, each containing two 3 oz. cans of Sesame Chicken and two 3 oz. cans of Chicken Pot Pie cat food.  The ingredients for each flavor are as follows:<br /><br />Sesame Chicken Entr&eacute;e:  Chicken, Chicken broth, Carrots, Sesame oil, Soy bean oil, Rice, Tricalcium phosphate, Guar gum, Tapioca starch, Calcium sulfate, Salt, Vitamins & Minerals (Vitamin E, Vitamin A, Vitamin D3, Zinc sulfate, Thaimine mononitrate, Manganese sulfate, Menadione sodium bisulfite complex &lt;source of vitamin K>, Riboflavin, Folic acid, Pyridoxine hydrochloride, Copper amino acid complex, Iron amino acid complex), Carrageenan, Choline chloride, Taurine.<br /><br />Chicken Pot Pie Entr&eacute;e:  Chicken, Chicken broth, Sweet Potato, Carrots, Soy bean oil, Tapioca starch, Tricalcium phosphate, Guar gum, Calcium sulfate, Olive oil, Vitamins & Minerals (Vitamin E, Vitamin A, Vitamin D3, Zinc sulfate, Thaimine mononitrate, Manganese sulfate, Menadione sodium bisulfite complex &lt;source of vitamin K>, Riboflavin, Folic acid, Pyridoxine hydrochloride, Copper amino acid complex, Iron amino acid complex), Carrageenan, Choline chloride, Taurine.<br /><br />As you can see, the ingredients in the two flavors are nearly identical.  One controversial ingredient contained in both flavors is Menadione Sodium Bisulfite, which is a synthetic version of vitamin K.  MSB has been called \"potentially harmful\" by many researchers, and is not allowed in human food.  However, the FDA does not restrict the use of MSB in pet foods, and these pet foods are even able to proudly claim \"Natural\" on the label, even if it contains this un-natural ingredient.  Studies indicate that Menadione Sodium Bisulfite can be toxic in high doses, and the tests indicate that this synthetic vitamin supplement can prove toxic to kidneys, lungs, liver, and mucous membranes.  Since I only use the Petite Cuisine food as a supplement to my cat's regular food, I don't consider the levels of MSB to be high enough to put my animals in any danger.  However, it is up to the owner to determine if they find this risk acceptable or not.  You can find more information about Menadione (Vitamin K3) here:<br /> http://www.dogfoodproject.com/index.php?page=menadione<br /><br />The manufacturer website (http://www.petitecuisine.com) says that \"Petite Cuisine is People Food for Cats.\"  There is no wheat gluten, no grain fillers, and no meat byproducts.  The label on the cans says \"Product of Thailand\", and the website boasts that nothing about this food is sourced from China.  All of the meat and vegetables are steam cooked, and each variety is hand packed into each and every can (according to the manufacturer).<br /><br />We have been feeding the Chicken Pot Pie and Sesame Chicken Petite Cuisine entr&eacute;es to our three Bengal cats for the past several days now.  We dispense one can onto a saucer for all three cats to share, once each day.  One thing my wife and I really like about this food is that it doesn't have an unpleasant odor, like most canned pet foods.  It smells like chicken and gravy, and although neither of us are daring enough to try a taste ourselves, our noses tend to support the claim that this is \"people food for cats.\"  The chicken pot pie entr&eacute;e contains several chunks of white meat chicken, along with small bits of sweet potato and carrots, all swimming in an ocean of gravy (or broth, sauce, or whatever you wish to call it).  The food looks good, but I feel that there is just too much gravy, and it could prove to be messy when serving or during feeding.  The sesame chicken entr&eacute;e contains shredded chicken (not chunks), along with bits of carrots and rice in a far more reasonable amount of gravy.  Both entr&eacute;es look good and smell good, but how do the cats like it?  Well as we observed our cats when we served up the food, here is what we found:<br /><br />Chicken Pot Pie Entr&eacute;e:  Asia, our 3 year old female Bengal, greedily devours the hearty chunks of chicken and veggie bits, but leaves most of the gravy behind.  Neo, our 10 month old male Bengal, also enjoys the chicken and licks up quite a bit of the gravy, but doesn't seem at all interested in the bits of sweet potato and carrots.  Matrix, our 2 year old male Bengal always approaches the food, sniffs at it for several seconds, and ultimately walks away without eating any.  Matrix will take a little taste, every now and then, but isn't interested in eating any quantity of it.<br /><br />Sesame Chicken Entr&eacute;e:  Asia again scarfs down the chicken and veggies, but leaves behind the rice and gravy.  Neo seems to eat a little bit of everything.  Matrix again sniffs at the food but will not eat any of it.<br /><br />So overall we have encountered very mixed results with our three cats.  Of course they are cats, so being somewhat finicky is only natural.  Two of the three seem to really enjoy the Petite Cuisine chicken entr&eacute;es, while the third doesn't care for it at all.  So would we buy this variety of Petite Cuisine in the future?  Well I think we will likely try some of the other varieties first, to see if we can get all three cats to enjoy the food.  Petite Cuisine also makes Yellow Fin Tuna, Red Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp, and New England Crab Cake varieties, which all sound like something our cats would like.  We are going to order the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BDDTB2\">Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp) for Cats, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, and see how our cats like these varieties. My wife and I both feel that Petite Cuisine produces great quality food, with high quality ingredients, and we will certainly buy more of their products in the future.  I do admit that I wish they didn't use the synthetic Vitamin K supplement (Menadione), simply because so many others have expressed real concern about the potential risks of this ingredient.  Many other manufacturers have removed this ingredient from their products, so maybe PetPlay, Inc. (makers of Petite Cuisine) will omit this synthetic ingredient in the future if enough consumer concern is expressed.  I do recommend the Petite Cuisine chicken varieties of cat food to other cat owners, but do so with a bit of caution due to the inclusion of the controversial Menadione Sodium Bisulfite ingredient.  If Petite Cuisine tastes as good as it looks and smells, then I am sure all but the most finicky cats will enjoy it a great deal.\n",

I also like that it comes in a 5 pack vs. a 12 pack. Although I was happy w/ the Pavich brand (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FMZXL4/ref=ox_ya_os_product), they came in a pack of 12 and used organic evaporated cane juice as the sweetener. I don't see how anyone would be disappointed in this product. I've also bought organic canned beans,popcorn and other foodstuffs from Eden Organic and have consistently been pleased w/ their quality.

It doesn't taste stale if you can't heat it and it stays fairly good for a few days just sitting on the counter in a Ziploc.  It works just fine using my Kitchen Aid mixer and my oven, I didn't need a bread machine.<br /><br />The suggestion on the package to add 2 TBSP molasses for a whole wheat bread taste makes a good GF bread great.  Also, I've continued using a tip I picked up somewhere to substitute 1/4 cup of ground flaxseed + 1/4 cup water for 2 eggs (more fiber, less fat).  These two things turn out a good brown bread that makes a great ham & Swiss w/ stone ground mustard.<br /><br />Amazon Subscribe & Save has the best price on this product that I've seen.

      "Ghee (clarified butter) has been used in India for ages, it can be used as a substitue for oil or butter, in most applications. It's a healthier option to butter and the other questionable frying mediums in use today.<br /><br />A more detailed description from http://www.pcta.org/general/ghee.asp :<br />\"ghee is unsalted butter that has been baked to remove not only its butter fat solids, as in drawn butter, but also all water -- so as to produce a food that contains no molecular oxygen, and is thus extremely storable and not subject to rancidity as in normal cooking oils. The health advantages accrue from the fact that ghee contains no oxidized cholesterol, the kind which leads to free radical damage in the cells of the body. Ghee is pretty well known among nurtrition nuts, plus it's a staple within Asian Indian communities and can be purchased in specialty food stores. It looks just like butter in a jar\"<br /><br />For those new to Ghee, do bear in mind it has a unique odor and flavor that may take some getting used to. The odor is not really strong and is somewhat buttery.<br /><br />If this is your first time trying it and you don't like it, you can always use it instead of butter for baking, provided the dish you are baking has a reasonably pleasant odor of it's own. Overall, the quality of the product itself is really good and it tastes great.<br /><br />I like the small 8oz jars instead of one large one, it's easier to handle them and you don't need to scoop some out into a smaller container for daily use. Once a can is over, just pop open a new one. Also, ghee has a long shelf life and you don't need to refrigerate the unopened jars. However, if you don't plan on using up an open bottle in about a month, it helps to store the container in the refrigerator, especially in summer!\n",
